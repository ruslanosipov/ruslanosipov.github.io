My name is Ruslan Osipov and I live in San Diego, California. I am a software engineer at Google.

I've now published two editions of my book - [Mastering Vim](https://amzn.to/2EfGaN5), pick it up and let me know what you think!

I'm not very active online, but you can find me on the following websites:

* [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ruslanosipov)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/ruslanosipov)
* [Reddit](http://reddit.com/u/rosipov)
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2578489/rosipov)

My first/last name combination is surprisingly common. It's probably not me if it's not in the list above.
