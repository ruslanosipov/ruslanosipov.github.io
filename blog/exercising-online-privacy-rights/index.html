        Exercising online privacy rights
        
    </h1>

<div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Following Europe&rsquo;s 2016 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California passed its own California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in 2020. I won&rsquo;t pretend to understand the intricacies of the law or the differences between the two, but from what I understand this gives you the right to know exactly what data of yours do businesses use, and request that this information is to not be sold or to be deleted.</p>

<p>As a California resident, I decided to dedicate a long weekend to exercising my privacy rights. The long weekend turned into a week worth of back and forth with a dozen-or-so companies, and me having a much better idea of what information about me is out there.</p>

<p>Turned out many large websites provide privacy dashboards where you&rsquo;re able to review and see information collected or inferred about you. But most of this data is hidden behind a formal request process which takes a few days to a week.</p>

<hr />

<p>First, I decided to stroll through Google&rsquo;s privacy settings. There are two ways forward: privacy dashboard, or full-on Google Takeout. Google Takeout allows you to download an archive of <strong>everything</strong> Google has on you, which took a few days to process, and is near impossible to go through while keeping your sanity. So I decided to play with the privacy dashboard instead.</p>

<p>Google Maps has location history of most places I&rsquo;ve visited for the past ten or so years (creepy, but I found it useful on more than one occasion), and YouTube and Search history stores thousands of searches. I already had Assistant history disabled, since storing audio recordings is apparently where I draw the line when it comes to privacy. Targeted ad profile was an interesting thing to look at, accurately summing up my lifestyle in 50 words or less. I ended up disabling targeted ads from Google (and all other services as I went about on my privacy crusade).</p>

<p>Google had some of the finest privacy controls compared to other services, with actionable privacy-leaning suggestions. Google&rsquo;s not known for its services playing well together, but privacy is where Google feels closer to Apple experience - everything is in a single place, surfaced in the same format, easy to control, and plays well together. Given the amount of transparency and fine grained control, I feel pretty good staying in the Google ecosystem.</p>

<hr />

<p>Next I looked at LinkedIn. Outside of the expected things &ndash; emails, phone numbers, messages, invitations, and a history of just about everything I&rsquo;ve ever clicked on, a file labeled &ldquo;inferences&rdquo; stood out. Whether LinkedIn thinks you&rsquo;re open to job seeking opportunities, or what stage of career you are in, or if you travel for businesses, or if you&rsquo;re a recruiter or maybe a senior leader in your company.</p>

<p>Since LinkedIn is a professional network, all information I share is well curated and is meant as public by default &ndash; and I found LinkedIn privacy settings in line with my expectations.</p>

<hr />

<p>As an avid gamer, I went through Steam, Good Old Games, Ubisoft, Epic Games, and Origin privacy details. Unsurprisingly, the services tracked every time I launched every game, shopping preferences, and so on. Thankfully the data seemed confined to the world of gaming &ndash; which made this level of being creepy somewhat okay in my book.</p>

<p>I also looked at random websites I use somewhat frequently &ndash; Reddit, StackOverflow, PayPal, Venmo, AirBnB, and some others &ndash; not too many surprises there, although I did end up tightening privacy settings and opting out of personal data sharing and ad tracking for every service.</p>

<p>Last year I requested deletion of all my data on Mint, Personal Capital, and YNAB (You Need a Budget), and to be honest I&rsquo;m a little relived that I didn&rsquo;t have to look at the data these companies had on me.</p>

<hr />

<p>Amazon data sharing turned out to be the scariest finding. Until now I didn&rsquo;t really self-identify as a heavy Amazon user, but that turned out to be a lie: Prime shopping, Kindle, Audible, Prime Video.</p>

<p>The amount of data Amazon kept on me was overwhelming: Kindle and Audible track every time I read, play, or pause books, the Amazon website keeps full track of browsing habits, and Prime Video has detailed watch times and history. Most of this data ties back into real world &ndash; including nearly every address I ever lived at or phone numbers I had.</p>

<p>Even scarier, despite never using Alexa, I found numerous recordings of my voice from close to a decade ago &ndash; me checking status of the packages, but a few of me just breathing and walking around. I found no way of deleting these, as they didn&rsquo;t show up in any privacy settings (including me installing an Alexa app just to get into privacy settings).</p>

<p>All of this gave me pause. It feels like the privacy controls are either lacking, hidden, or spread out thin across Amazon&rsquo;s various apps. And I&rsquo;ve only briefly scanned through the data Amazon had on me.</p>

<hr />

<p>That&rsquo;s where I had to take a break.</p>

<p>I have accounts with hundreds of services, and I have no idea how my personal data is used, and what it&rsquo;s joined with. As I&rsquo;m go on about my daily life, I&rsquo;ll start tightening privacy controls, and maybe deleting services and their data where possible.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just too creepy for my taste.</p>
