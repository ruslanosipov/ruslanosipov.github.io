    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I write about Vim &ndash; a modal text editor &ndash; <a href="/blog/categories/vim">a lot</a>. In fact, in early 2018
I was approached by a <a href="https://packtpub.com">Packt Publishing</a> &ndash; what I&rsquo;ve later learned to be a
&ldquo;quantity over quality&rdquo; publishing house. Over the next 6 to 9 months I wrote a
300-page <a href="https://amzn.to/3wBeTx4">&ldquo;Mastering Vim&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>It was a stressful endeavour, with a publisher rushing to meet internal
deadlines and eventually sending an unfinished draft to print. There were many
highlights too, like actually cranking out 300 pages of material, or getting to
work with Bram Moolenaar &ndash; the creator of Vim himself. Now that a few years
have passed and the book is at its 3rd edition, complete, and re-released &ndash;
I&rsquo;m a lot more happy with the result.</p>

<p>I can write a whole other essay about my experience working with the publisher,
but that&rsquo;s a horror story for another time.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t write to make money, but it&rsquo;s nice seeing a couple of hundred dollars
trickling in every quarter. Putting together spreadhseets is my favorite past
time, so here&rsquo;s a breakdown of my earnings from the time I wrote a book with
Packt.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/mastering-vim-amazon.png" title="A screenshot of &ldquo;Mastering Vim&rdquo; on Amazon.com." ></p>

<p>As of April 2021, the English version of my book has 14 reviews on Amazon
averaging at 5 stars (that&rsquo;s more than I would hope for), which likely helps
keep the sales at a somewhat of a steady level.</p>

<p>I was signed into a default &ldquo;16% of net receipts&rdquo; contract, with a $2,000
advance given out to me. The advance was split into 5 milestone-based
installments: the first preliminary draft, 6 preliminary drafts, the remaining
preliminary drafts, the final drafts, and the publication. Although I didn&rsquo;t
urgently need the money, and the publisher may have just sent it as a bulk
$2,000 payment after the publication.</p>

<p>Eventually I received a PDF for the first quarter of my book being sold&hellip; And
here are the financials for Q4 2018:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Print # </th>
<th> Print $ </th>
<th> E-books # </th>
<th> E-books $ </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> 10      </td>
<td> $55.50  </td>
<td> 274       </td>
<td> $307.70   </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>A whopping 363 dollars and 20 cents in royalties! I didn&rsquo;t really think anyone
would be interested to read the book, so seeing 284 copies sold I was pretty
ecstatic!</p>

<p>Selling printed books seems to pay $5.55 per copy, while e-books only bring me
$1.12.</p>

<p>Now I didn&rsquo;t see any of that money, since I would have to &ldquo;pay back&rdquo; the
advance. I know it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;the advance&rdquo;, and I knew that I won&rsquo;t be getting
that first check in the mail &ndash; but it sucked a bit nonetheless.</p>

<p>After that I received some great news &ndash; my book was going to get
<a href="https://amzn.to/3fN7mFz">translated to Japanese</a>! During my last trip to Tokyo I made some friends
who were interested in Vim as much as I was, and one of them - Masafumi Okura -
decided to translate &ldquo;Mastering Vim&rdquo; into his native language. The legend found
close to three dozen mistakes in my book too, and is solely responsible for the
third edition of Mastering Vim!</p>

<p>Turns out the translation rights are expensive, and I&rsquo;m getting my cut as well
&ndash; $1,586.26! That&rsquo;s more than the first quarter of sales!</p>

<p>Packt advertised my book for a few months or so, but they seemed to have
quickly lost interest. I received my first 5 star review on Amazon though,
which was great! I spent the next month refreshing Amazon reviews daily, after
realizing that to be a path to acquiring a mental illness.</p>

<p>2019 came, and here are my next 4 quarterly statements:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Quarter      </th>
<th> Print # </th>
<th> Print $ </th>
<th> E-books # </th>
<th> E-books $ </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> 2019 Q1      </td>
<td> 29      </td>
<td> $141.89 </td>
<td> 202       </td>
<td> $337.49   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 2019 Q2      </td>
<td> 15      </td>
<td> $77.53  </td>
<td> 71        </td>
<td> $194.26   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 2019 Q3      </td>
<td> 19      </td>
<td> $100.09 </td>
<td> 57        </td>
<td> $207.68   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 2019 Q4      </td>
<td> 23      </td>
<td> $118.55 </td>
<td> 117       </td>
<td> $255.17   </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>I sold 86 print books and 447 e-books in 2021. You can see the higher numbers
correspond to seasonal sales. Notice the prices for Q3 and Q4. E-books sold in
Q3 pay me as much as $3.64 per copy, while in Q1 it&rsquo;s a meager $1.67 per book.
Print edition payout stays much more consistent.</p>

<p>Altogether, I earned $1432.66 from my first full year of selling &ldquo;Mastering
Vim&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Here are my 2021 earnings:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Quarter      </th>
<th> Print # </th>
<th> Print $ </th>
<th> E-books # </th>
<th> E-books $ </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> 2020 Q1      </td>
<td> 26      </td>
<td> $131.61 </td>
<td> 112       </td>
<td> $414.12   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 2020 Q2      </td>
<td> 22      </td>
<td> $106.67 </td>
<td> 77        </td>
<td> $379.61   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 2020 Q3      </td>
<td> 26      </td>
<td> $141.17 </td>
<td> 74        </td>
<td> $325.97   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 2020 Q4      </td>
<td> 45      </td>
<td> $236.69 </td>
<td> 166       </td>
<td> $458.07   </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>That&rsquo;s $1,533.38, a $100 more than in 2021. The patterns seem rather
predictable, with Q2 and Q3 being slow, and Q1 and Q4 displaying a noticeable
spike.</p>

<p>Finally, Packt offers service subscriptions &ndash; I believe the subscription is for
the courses they offer, but I can&rsquo;t say for sure. Payout per subscription is
small, and I&rsquo;ve earned $158.10 over the 9 quarters since publishing &ldquo;Mastering
Vim&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Across $3,329.24 in book sales, $1,586.26 in translation fees, and $158.10 in
subscriptions, this adds up to $5,073.60 over the 2+ years the book has been in
print. Looks like it can make for a decent supplemental income if you write
enough books, but I&rsquo;m saying that based on a sample size of one.</p>

<p>Throughout this time, my earnings per copy average at $5.16 for a print, and
$1.93 for an e-book (using weighted averages for quarterly sales).</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the last number in this post &ndash; this one purely for fun. Based on
the 16% royalty rate, Packt probably earned $31,710 from &ldquo;Mastering Vim&rdquo; so
far.</p>

    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/the-feedback-fallacy/"/>
    <updated>2021-04-06T01:32:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/the-feedback-fallacy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After learning about <a href="https://amzn.to/3ukVvm5">&ldquo;Radical Candor&rdquo;</a>, I became obsessed with providing candid and compassionate feedback. I&rsquo;ve been especially focused on the ability to communicate areas of growth for individual on my team.</p>

<p>And then a colleague of mine shared <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/03/the-feedback-fallacy">&ldquo;The Feedback Fallacy&rdquo;</a> (published in the Harvard Business Review), which points to some research and outlines a few key problems why focusing on negative feedback might not be the best choice. Research shows that:</p>

<ul>
<li>people are bad at assessing other people</li>
<li>we learn best with positive reinforcement</li>
<li>focusing on shortcomings impairs learning</li>
<li>excellence is specific to an individual</li>
</ul>


<p>Like many pieces of business literature, it reads like an &ldquo;all-or-nothing&rdquo; approach (&ldquo;negative feedback - bad, positive feedback - good&rdquo;), and the most effective approach is likely somewhere in the middle. There&rsquo;s a place for positive and negative feedback, and it&rsquo;s the focus on positive reinforcement that I see as a primary takeaway from this article.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that my assessment of others&#8217; performance changes over time. It often depends on what self-help book I&rsquo;m reading at the moment if I&rsquo;m being entirely honest.</p>

<p>This piece made me think of the portrayal of successful people in media: there&rsquo;s an inherent cultural belief that successful people know what makes them successful, and all you need to do is to follow in their steps! What is often omitted is a mix of luck, some talent or hard work, topped with another serving of being in the right place at the right time. Warren Buffet can probably tell you what&rsquo;s the smartest thing to do with ten thousand dollars you have in your savings account. It&rsquo;s unlikely that his advice alone will get you to his <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=warren+buffett+net+worth">98.2 billion dollar net worth</a>.</p>

<p>It seems like once you get past basic competency, success identifiers seem unpredictable.</p>

<p>I attribute part of my professional success to having a reputation of a person who &ldquo;gets shit done&rdquo;. I naturally value qualities associated with that style of work. It&rsquo;s only natural that I prioritize on communication and organizational skills when assessing the performance of others.</p>

<p>In fact, the article made me think about how I landed with the reputation as a problem solver. Every time I accomplished a project on time, owned the problem space, involved the right parties, or raised alarms early &ndash; I received positive reinforcement. People I worked with valued those qualities, and years working with those people shaped what I perceive as an effective work style.</p>

<p>Yet, this work style is effective for me, and is not a solution for my peers.</p>

<p>Since reading <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/03/the-feedback-fallacy">&ldquo;The Feedback Fallacy&rdquo;</a>, I started focusing on the outcomes I like, as opposed to qualities I believe are valuable. Where before I would say &ldquo;Great comms on project X!&rdquo;, now I focus on specifics: &ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re up to on project X, which helps me communicate with stakeholder Y and plan resources for the project Z&rdquo;</p>

    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/take-a-pause-before-that-email/"/>
    <updated>2021-03-28T18:12:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/take-a-pause-before-that-email</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m not an ill tempered person, and it takes quite a lot to get me riled up. In
the pandemic however getting frustrated has been oh so much easier!</p>

<p>For once, there are less face to face interactions, which makes me feel removed
from whomever I&rsquo;m talking to. The interactions that happen over video chat feel
a lot less personal, and despite regular deliberately scheduled 1:1 time it&rsquo;s
harder to connect with colleagues on a personal level.</p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s the lack of water cooler interactions between meetings. A colleague
of mine correctly pointed out that before the era of video chat meetings, we&rsquo;d
have the time to decompress and process content between meetings with those
micro-interactions. Having just a minute or two &ldquo;off the record&rdquo; after a large
call helps process, frame, and align prior interaction. And just sharing a laugh
or being able to say &ldquo;well that was stressful&rdquo; helps reduce the inevitable daily
stress buildup.</p>

<p>Finally, all of the above is true for everyone else - and we&rsquo;re already in a
melting pot of individuals with different communication styles. People are
getting frustrated, making other people even more frustrated. It&rsquo;s a frustration
chain reaction!</p>

<p>All of this led to me into a cycle of sending some snappy responses, feeling
terrible after time would pass, setting up time to profusely apologize face to
face, and wowing to never overreact to work stress sources again&hellip; Until the
next encounter that is. It all culminated with me getting entirely too
frustrated between 8:00 and 8:05 am last Thursday and taking a day just to
decompress.</p>

<p>And that reminded of something I&rsquo;ve learned years ago, and I something I would
practice with rigour - until the background frustration level rose that is.</p>

<p>Early in my career I&rsquo;ve been taught to cool down before sending that angry ping
or an email &ndash; type it up, leave it in my drafts - come back to it an hour or
two later.</p>

<p>In 9 out of 10 cases I end up deleting the message feeling relieved that an
incoherent stream of hatred never saw the light of day. Most of the time when
I&rsquo;m angry I don&rsquo;t really have a goal I&rsquo;m trying to accomplish (other than inform
all the parties involved of my feelings), and that&rsquo;s not a great basis for
professional communication.</p>

<p>In the remaining case, I would end up completely rewriting that email to remove
the hostile tone and focus on the source of the issue instead. There are
problems that are worth addressing with candor &ndash; but candor is too often
conflated for the lack of tact.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to take a break at work - because there are often so many things
to do, and so little time to do them. Which makes taking a minute to breather
feel like a waste of time, when it&rsquo;s one of the most productive things you can
do in the long run.</p>

<p>So here I am, putting these thoughts into writing to remember to take a break
before initiating aggressive communications &ndash; hopefully the more I think about
this, the easier it gets to remember to pause, self-assess, and disconnect.</p>

    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/on-mentorship/"/>
    <updated>2021-03-27T12:08:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/on-mentorship</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of months ago I had a conversation with a fellow employee &ndash; let&rsquo;s call
him Balgruuf &ndash; who decided to quit the grind and become a career coach.
Shortly after I&rsquo;ve witnessed them interact with our mutual acquaintance &ndash;
Farengar &ndash; who was in a difficult spot in their career. Balgruuf was
enthusiastically instructing on what are the exact steps Farengar must take, and
in what order. It generally felt like Balgruuf had this whole career thing
figured out, and Farengar just stumbled along. Needless to say, Farengar quickly
changed the topic.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t stopped thinking about mentorship since that day. In the 10 or so
years of my career so far, I&rsquo;ve had a number of mentors - both formal and
informal. I also get the opportunity to mentor people around me &ndash; both sides of
the relationship really fascinate me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had some mentors who worked really well for me - and some who didn&rsquo;t. I
also had more different level of success with mentoring people myself. And one
of the defining factors in a successful experience was this: people conflate
mentorship with giving advice &ndash; two different, but oh-so-close feeling things.
Let me elaborate on the difference with a tangentially related example.</p>

<p>Sometimes my wife comes home and shares frustrations that inevitably arise after
a long day at work. There&rsquo;s little to no room for my input, because she needs
somebody to just listen, or maybe a rubber duck to talk at. And sometimes my
better half wants to hear my thoughts on the subject. Needing to vent and asking
for advice are two completely distinct scenarios in this case.</p>

<p>Just like in my home life, sometimes people come looking for an advice. But more
often than not, they&rsquo;re looking for mentorship.</p>

<p>Giving advice is prescriptive, while mentorship is more nuanced, and takes more
finesse from both parties.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://amzn.to/2NYlWPb">Relationomics</a>, Randy Ross discusses a role that
relationships play in personal growth. He talks about the harmful &ldquo;self help&rdquo;
culture which discounts the value of human element in self-development.</p>

<p>This is the gap where mentorship fits in. There&rsquo;s one huge &ldquo;but&rdquo; though, and
that&rsquo;s the fact that the person needs to be ready for the specific feedback they
might be getting.</p>

<p>Mentor is there to guide the internal conversation, encourage insight, and
suggest a direction. Mentor is there to identify when someone who&rsquo;s being
mentored is heading in a completely wrong direction, or not addressing the
elephant in the room.</p>

<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ve been noticing a trend at Google to avoid trying to use the word
&ldquo;mentorship&rdquo; overall, to avoid the go-to advice slinging attitude of your
everyday Balgruuf. And it&rsquo;s been a helpful trend - since framing mentorship
relationship around guidance and reminding mentors to let those who are mentored
to drive the growth is crucial for healthy peer to peer learning.</p>

<p>Even if so-called mentor has some aspect of life completely figured out for
themselves, the person who&rsquo;s mentored must drive the whole journey. Otherwise
there&rsquo;s really no room for growth in that relationship.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Adjusting to working from home]]></title>
    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/adjusting-to-wfh/"/>
    <updated>2020-05-04T17:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/adjusting-to-wfh</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Like many, I moved to working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parts of California enacted shelter-in-place order back in March, and it&rsquo;s been over a month and a half since then. I briefly worked from home back in 2013 as a freelancer - and I really got the whole work/life balance thing wrong. So this time around I&rsquo;ve decided to approach remote work with a plan.</p>

<p>My day begins around 7 or 8 am, without too much deviation from schedule. I used to bike to work before the pandemic, and I try to head out for a 30 minute ride in a morning a few days a week. There aren&rsquo;t a lot of people out early, and I love starting my day with some light cardio.</p>

<p>I share breakfast and coffee with my partner, often while catching up on our favorite morning TV show. At the moment I&rsquo;m being educated on Avatar: The Last Airbender. Ugh, Azula!</p>

<p>Breakfast is followed by a calendar sync. We check if either of us have overlapping or sensitive meetings. That way we know which calls either of us needs to take in another room - and which are okay to have in our workspace. Both of our desks are in the living room, and we use <a href="https://amzn.to/3ferNbP">noise cancelling headphones</a> throughout the day to help with focus. During the day we convert our bedroom to an ad hoc conference room.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/wfh-setup.jpg" title="A picture of my work-from-home setup." ></p>

<p>By 9 am, I have my desk set up: I replace my personal laptop with its corporate-issued counterpart. An <a href="https://amzn.to/2SwMCpc">external webcam</a> helps with the image quality, and a dedicated <a href="https://amzn.to/2W0vREV">display</a>, keyboard (<a href="http://www.vortexgear.tw/vortex2_2.asp?kind=47&amp;kind2=220&amp;kind3=&amp;kind4=999">Vortex Pok3r</a> with <a href="https://drop.com/buy/91600">Matt3o Nerd DSA</a> key cap set), and a mouse (<a href="https://amzn.to/2SwNWbE">Glorious Model O-</a>) alleviate the cramped feeling I get when using a laptop.</p>

<p>Most importantly, I&rsquo;m showered, groomed, and dressed by this time. While working in whatever I slept in has worked well for occasional remote Fridays, it proved to be unsustainable for prolonged remote work. Whenever I wasn&rsquo;t dressed for work, I found myself slowly drifting towards the couch, and trading a laptop for my phone. In fact, some days I dress up even more than I used to when going to the office!</p>

<p>This is where the clear separation between home and work is established. I&rsquo;m fully dressed and have my workstation set up: it&rsquo;s work time!</p>

<p>I spend the next few hours busy with heads down work, usually working on a design, writing some code, or doing anything which requires concentration. Playing something like a <a href="https://rainycafe.com/">Rainy Cafe</a> in the background helps me stay in the zone.</p>

<p>Back in the office, 11 am used to be my workout time: a gym buddy of mine would consistency exercise at 11 am, and I adopted the habit of joining him over the past few years. I decided not to move the time slot: at 11 am I change into my workout clothes and exercise: 30 to 45 minutes of bodyweight exercises or online classes use up the remainder of my morning willpower. I&rsquo;m so glad there are thousands of YouTube videos to keep me company!</p>

<p>My partner and I alternate cooking, and the next hour or so is reserved for cooking, lunch together, and cleanup. Remember the noise cancelling headphones? We haven&rsquo;t heard (and often seen) each other since morning! Getting to share lunch daily has definitely been the highlight of staying at home for me.</p>

<p>After that - back to work: design reviews, meetings, busywork.</p>

<p>I wrap up around 5 pm, and make a point not to work past that. I swap out my work laptop for my own (even if I&rsquo;m not planning to use it), and stow it away for the night. Disassembling my setup paired with showering and changing into house clothes creates a solid dividing line between work and home.</p>

<p>Cooking dinner together and evening activities follow, but that&rsquo;s a story for another time. Stay healthy and productive!</p>
