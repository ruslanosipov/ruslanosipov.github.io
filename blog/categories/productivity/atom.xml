    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Disclaimer: I am not advocating any specific tools or methodologies, I am
simply sharing workflow I find to be efficient and pleasant.</em></p>

<p>I am a huge fan of working with CLI applications. I use Vim for editing code,
composing emails, and various kinds of writing. When I have to manipulate huge
amounts of email, I use Mutt: it&rsquo;s intuitive tagging and regular expression
engine are extremely useful for the task. I employ <code>ack</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>grep</code>, and
<code>sed</code> - Linux utilities which allow for precise and fast text manipulation.</p>

<p>However, I would not use CLI browsers like <code>elinks</code> or <code>w3m</code>, and the idea of
reading every email in Mutt gives me crepes. I love the visualization web
browser offers, something text-based prompt is not able to provide. And it
doesn&rsquo;t have to.</p>

<p>There are two components to most of the tasks performed on a computer: analyzing
output and entering input. Certain tasks employ one component more than the
other. In most modern applications it&rsquo;s rare to have both solid control from
the user perspective and a pleasant informative UI. With increased visual
component, it&rsquo;s more time consuming to make the application do what you need,
especially if your needs are esoteric. With more editing power, visual display
becomes less complex in order to make editing tasks easier.</p>

<h2>Where visual tools fall short</h2>

<p>What is the alternative? Using multiple programs with different levels of
control to accomplish one task: to edit text. Each of the programs excels in
it&rsquo;s own field: word processing software allows for beautiful fonts and document
presentation, IDE lets you access aggregated meta information about your
application. But most of the IDEs and word processors lack the powerful tools
needed to manipulate the foundation of what user is working with - plain text.</p>

<h2>Ode to plain text</h2>

<p>I spend a lot of time writing and editing plain text. Be it source code, emails,
documentation, or even blog posts. These tasks take up significant amount of my
day, and it is only logical to substitute some of the visual presentation
capabilities for effectiveness.</p>

<p>It is hard to mentally process data which is not explicitly and unambiguously
visible: different levels of headings, hidden meta information. Unlike more
obscuring formats, plain text is all there is - it has nothing to hide. If you
don&rsquo;t see it - it&rsquo;s not there. If you do see it - you know exactly what it is.</p>

<p>One of my favorite tips from &ldquo;<a href="http://amzn.to/1yRe6Th">Pragmatic Programmer</a>&rdquo; goes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Use a single editor well</p></blockquote>

<p>So I learned one editor well, and now I use it for all my writing and editing
needs. I don&rsquo;t have to jump between IDE, browser, and office software. Most of
the text I edit is manipulated with one editor. There is only one set of key
bindings to know, one skill to master and hone. Fast, without any additional
thought, using single text editor and all of it&rsquo;s powerful features is imprinted
in muscle memory. One less task to worry about.</p>

<p>I write my documents in Markdown format, and later convert them to the desired
output using <code>pandoc</code>: be it an HTML page, PDF, or a Microsoft Word document. I
use Vim, so I can rearrange paragraphs or manipulate lines within a couple of
keystrokes. Since I spend so much time editing text, I also touch type, which
makes me even more effective at the given task.</p>

<h2>Harness the power of the command line</h2>

<p>When it comes to bulk manipulating files or working with version control -
there is no better candidate then command line applications. There&rsquo;s no need to
go through a number of obscure menus, ticking and unticking checkboxes, and
hoping that your desired result can be achieved with a program&rsquo;s GUI.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a few scenarios some users face in their daily workflow.</p>

<h3>Creating a backup</h3>

<p>With GUI, you&rsquo;d have to take multiple steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Right click <code>file</code>.</li>
<li>Left click on &ldquo;Copy&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Right click on some empty space.</li>
<li>Left click on &ldquo;Paste&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Right click on a newly created copy.</li>
<li>Left click on &ldquo;Rename&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Switch to a keyboard.</li>
<li>Type <code>file.bak</code>.</li>
</ol>


<p>The above steps can be sped up using shortcuts like <code>C-c</code> or <code>C-v</code>, but not by
much. Here&rsquo;s an alternative in bash:</p>

<pre><code>cp file{,.bak}
</code></pre>

<p>While first variant would do great for a novice or a casual user - the second
method would be much more preferred by an experienced user whose concern is
speed.</p>

<h3>Recursively bulk replacing text in a directory</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume we want to do a bulk replace text in a directory and all it&rsquo;s
subdirectories. We have our trusted IDE, let&rsquo;s assume this IDE is already
configured to work with a desired directory.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open your IDE.</li>
<li>Select &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; menu.</li>
<li>Select &ldquo;Find and Replace&rdquo; submenu.</li>
<li>Click on a &ldquo;Find&rdquo; input field.</li>
<li>Switch to a keyboard.</li>
<li>Type <code>function_to_replace</code>.</li>
<li>Switch to a mouse.</li>
<li>Click on &ldquo;Replace&rdquo; input field.</li>
<li>Switch to a keyboard.</li>
<li>Type <code>new_function_name</code>.</li>
<li>Switch to a mouse.</li>
<li>Enable &ldquo;Search in subdirectories&rdquo; checkbox.</li>
<li>Click &ldquo;OK&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>


<p>Again, this can be shortened a bit with some keyboard shortcuts, but not by
much. You still have to switch between keyboard and a mouse a total of 4 times,
and you still have to click through all the menus. This does get time consuming
if you do this often. Now let&rsquo;s try to perform the same task in command line:</p>

<pre><code>find . -type f | xargs sed -i 's/function_to_replace/new_function_name/g'
</code></pre>

<p>Much faster, if you&rsquo;re able to memorize the structure. And remembering what the
commands do is much easier than it looks. Especially with the help of <code>man</code> or,
even better, <code>bro</code> (see <a href="http://bropages.org">http://bropages.org</a> for latter).</p>

<h2>Is it worth learning CLI tools over their GUI counterparts?</h2>

<p>This depends on what your intentions are. If you&rsquo;re a power user who writes and
edits a lot of text or manipulates bulk amounts of text on a daily basis - than
it&rsquo;s definitely worth it. Time spent learning these tools will pay off. But if
you&rsquo;re a casual user whose needs end with writing an occasional email or two -
then you probably don&rsquo;t need to worry about this.</p>

<p>Hell, if you&rsquo;ve read this far - this means you&rsquo;re the former case. I can
practically guarantee that you will benefit from employing command line tools
and modal editors over their GUI counterparts.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve put together a table for comparison between two. Indeed, there are
different times when either GUI or CLI tools excel:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Factor                            </th>
<th> CLI </th>
<th> GUI </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Easy to learn                     </td>
<td> No  </td>
<td> Yes </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Efficient for a novice user       </td>
<td> No  </td>
<td> Yes </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Efficient for an experienced user </td>
<td> Yes </td>
<td> No  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Good for occasional use           </td>
<td> No  </td>
<td> Yes </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Good for repetitive tasks         </td>
<td> Yes </td>
<td> No  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Presents visual information well  </td>
<td> No  </td>
<td> Yes </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>As you can see - both CLI and GUI programs have their pluses and minuses. CLI
tools seem to appeal to experienced users, while GUI tools are great for novice
users and do excel in representing visual information. No matter what kind of
interface you prefer, it&rsquo;s crucially important to use the right tool for the job.</p>

    <updated>2015-02-05T10:40:33-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/custom-templates-in-vimwiki</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I got myself into a habit of using vimwiki for the past year: it helps me to
keep track of random bits of information, work and project notes, as well as
daily goals and achievements. You can read more about vimwiki in an article I
wrote a while back: &ldquo;<a href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/personal-wiki-with-vimwiki/">Personal wiki with vimwiki</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="/images/vimwiki-workflow-habits.png" title="HTML page generated by vimwiki with a custom navigation bar." ></p>

<p>One of vimwiki&rsquo;s features I really like is an ability to convert whole wiki to
HTML with a single command: <code>:VimwikiAll2HTML</code>. There is one annoyance though:
HTML vimwiki pages don&rsquo;t have any navigation elements: the only way to navigate
between pages is by clicking through links within a page or using browser&rsquo;s
&ldquo;back&rdquo; button.</p>

<p>Luckily, vimwiki has a setting which allows using custom templates for
generating HTML. Assuming your wiki is in <code>$HOME/Dropbox/wiki</code> (can be anywhere
else though), make following changes to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>let g:vimwiki_list = [{
  \ 'path': '$HOME/Dropbox/wiki',
  \ 'template_path': '$HOME/Dropbox/wiki/templates',
  \ 'template_default': 'default',
  \ 'template_ext': '.html'}]
</code></pre>

<p>After that, create a <code>$HOME/Dropbox/wiki/templates/default.html</code> using
<code>vimwiki/autoload/vimwiki/default.tpl</code> as a base. I added simple navigation bar
to my default template:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;link rel="Stylesheet" type="text/css" href="%root_path%style.css" /&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;%title%&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;a href="%root_path%index.html"&gt;Index&lt;/a&gt; |
    &lt;a href="%root_path%diary/diary.html"&gt;Diary&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;hr&gt;
    &lt;div class="content"&gt;
    %content%
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s much easier to jump between wiki entries. Of course, customization
doesn&rsquo;t end there: you can change styles, add JavaScript and make your wiki all
fancy and advanced.</p>

    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/beyond-grep/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-21T12:18:31-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/beyond-grep</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I search for things a lot, especially in my code. Or even worse - someone else&rsquo;s
code. For years <code>grep</code> served as an amazing tool for this: fast, simple, and
yet powerful. That was until I discovered <code>ack</code> for myself. An incredibly easy
to use <code>grep</code> implementation built to work with large (or not really) code
trees.</p>

<p>A lot can be said to enforce superiority of <code>ack</code> over <code>grep</code> when it comes to
working with code, and it&rsquo;s all said here: <a href="http://beyondgrep.com/why-ack/">ack&rsquo;s features</a>.</p>

<p>Amazing thing is - <code>ack</code> doesn&rsquo;t even need a tutorial. Learning progression is
natural and &ldquo;just happens&rdquo; by researching necessary use cases as the need
arises (<code>ack</code> has a great manual entry).</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a typical use example for <code>ack</code>:</p>

<pre><code>ack --shell 'gr[ae]y'
</code></pre>

<p>Searches all shell script files in the current code tree for any occurrences of
&ldquo;gray&rdquo; or &ldquo;grey&rdquo;. It will search <code>.sh</code>, <code>.zsh</code>, and just about dot-anything;
<code>ack</code> will even check shebang lines for you.</p>

<p>Ease of use, the fact that it&rsquo;s ready to use out of the box, extensive file
types, native support for Perl&rsquo;s regular expressions: <code>ack</code> does really good
job at searching through code.</p>

    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/effective-search-with-mutt/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-02T13:32:51-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/effective-search-with-mutt</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I generally don&rsquo;t use Mutt for everyday emails - I find smooth non-monospace
fonts to be more pleasant to the eye, and the visualization my browser offers
is hard to beat. The main use-case for me is composing long emails: Mutt lets
me use my favorite text editor, which speeds up the editing of long and
carefully composed responses.</p>

<p>Recently I added a new use-case to my work flow: searching through emails.
Mutt has a powerful built-in regular-expressions engine, which is something the
web Gmail client is missing.</p>

<p>Mutt has two ways of finding things: search and limit. &ldquo;Search&rdquo; just jumps from
one matching letter to another, something along the lines what <code>/</code> command does
in <code>less</code>, <code>more</code>, or <code>vim</code>. &ldquo;Limit&rdquo; is something I am more used to with the
web client, and it&rsquo;s what I use the most.</p>

<h2>Using limits</h2>

<p>Limit works the way regular search works in Gmail: it limits the view to
conversations matching the query. Hit <code>l</code>, and enter a search query.</p>

<p>By default, Mutt will only search through the subject lines, but this behaviour
can be changed by prefixing the command with a special identifier. For
instance, searching for <code>~b oranges</code> will limit the view to all the messages
which mention &ldquo;oranges&rdquo; in the message body. Here are a couple I use the most:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>~b</code> &ndash; Search in the message body.</li>
<li><code>~B</code> &ndash; Search in the whole message.</li>
<li><code>~f</code> &ndash; Message originated from the user.</li>
<li><code>~Q</code> &ndash; Messages which have been replied to.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can find full list in the <a href="http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/manual-4.html#ss4.2">Mutt Advanced Usage Manual</a>.</p>

<p>Patterns can be chained to produce narrower results: <code>~f joe ~B apples</code>. This
will search for a message mentioning &ldquo;apples&rdquo; coming from an author whose name
contains &ldquo;joe&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Caching mail for faster search</h3>

<p>You may find that searching whole messages is slow, especially if you have more
than a couple hundred messages to search through. That&rsquo;s because by default
Mutt does not store messages for local use. This can be changed by specifying
<code>header_cache</code> and <code>message_cachedir</code> variables in your <code>.muttrc</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>set header_cache     = "$HOME/Mail"
set message_cachedir = "$HOME/Mail"
</code></pre>

<p>Now, after you perform your first search, it will cache every message you open,
making all the consecutive searches lightning fast.</p>

<p>Oh, and keep in mind, Mutt stores messages and headers in plain text, so make
sure the cache directory is not shared with anyone but yourself.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Three favorite bash tricks]]></title>
    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/three-favorite-bash-tricks/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-24T18:41:10-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/three-favorite-bash-tricks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spend most of my development time in the shell - be it editing text with Vim
or executing various console commands. I have quite a number of tricks in my
daily repertoire, and I would like to share three tips today.</p>

<h2>Edit current command with a text editor</h2>

<p>I often end up having to change a long command I just typed, and using arrow
keys to get to the correct spot is not favorable. Bash has the feature which
lets you edit current command in a text editor of your choice. Hit <code>Ctrl + x</code>,
<code>Ctrl + e</code> (or <code>Ctrl + x + e</code>), and you will be dropped into your text editor.
Now you are able to edit the command, and it will be executed as soon as your
write the file and exit the editor.</p>

<p>You can use an editor of your choice by adding following line to your <code>.bashrc</code>
file:</p>

<pre><code>export EDITOR=vim
</code></pre>

<p>Replace <code>vim</code> with the name of your favorite editor.</p>

<p>Update: It looks like for some machines setting <code>EDITOR</code> variable is not
enough. In this case, you also need to set <code>VISUAL</code> environment variable.</p>

<h2>Edit recent command</h2>

<p>You can edit your recent commands in a text editor of your choice by executing
<code>fc beginning_of_the_command</code>. For instance, if you run <code>fc l</code>, you will open
most recent command starting with the letter &ldquo;l&rdquo;.</p>

<p>You can execute <code>fc</code> without any arguments to edit last executed command.</p>

<h2>Bash history autocomplete</h2>

<p>Another great feature - &ldquo;reverse intelligent search&rdquo;. If you hit <code>Ctrl + r</code> in
your shell, you&rsquo;ll be greeted by the following prompt:</p>

<pre><code>(reverse-i-search)`':
</code></pre>

<p>Start typing a part of the command from your history, and you&rsquo;ll see suggestions
popping up. Hit <code>Enter</code> to pick the command (you&rsquo;ll be able to edit it before
executing), or push <code>Ctrl + g</code> to return back.</p>

<p>Like any of these tips? Have some of your own? Don&rsquo;t hesitate to share those in
the comments section down below.</p>
