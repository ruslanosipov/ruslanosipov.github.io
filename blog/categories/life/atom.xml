    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>A close friend of mine has a story similar to mine. She wanted to share it for a while now, and I&rsquo;m humbled she chose my blog as a medium for telling her inspiring story to the strangers on the Internet:</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/friends-trip-plane.jpg" title="At Narita Airport, Japan." ></p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t count the number of times I have attempted to tell this story on paper. It all started 8 months ago when my then-husband, let&rsquo;s call him Carl, told me that he no longer loved me and was in love with someone else. There are a few moments in life that seem to happen in slow motion and this was one of them. Until then, my life had been being Carl&rsquo;s wife and in the blink of an eye, I had to figure out who I was in a world without Carl. I forced myself to write every thoughts I had, dark, depressed, once a day but it didn&rsquo;t stick. I bought various domain names hoping that it would give me the final push to start writing all this down but all the sites remained &ldquo;under construction&rdquo;. So here is my final attempt to write this up, organize my thoughts and hopefully let someone going through this know that they are not alone. How did I get here? Well funny you should ask, pull up a chair and listen to my tale.</p>

<p>Carl and I met when we were 22 and 18 respectively. It was far from love at first sight but he intrigued me. I had just got out of an unhealthy relationship and wanted something different and Carl was that, unapologetically himself. Up until then, I had always felt pressure to conform to the idea of who others wanted me to be and meeting Carl, who let&rsquo;s be honest was a straight nerd, was surprisingly refreshing and attractive. We dated for 5 years before getting married. We struggled with money throughout the first years of our relationship so when the opportunity to make more at a job I was unqualified for presented itself, we jumped at the chance. We packed our bags and moved for my job. Thus started the beginning of the end. I was so focused on keeping said job that I overworked, became a ball of nerves and lost all desires to do anything outside of work. While I struggled with the demand of the job, Carl found refuge with his younger, funner coworkers. We started living separate lives, which eventually led up to the fateful day when my husband told me that he loved someone else.</p>

<p>I will not bore you with the details of my attempts to become a stable, contributing member of society. It included a lot of sleepless night, Nutella for dinner, and lies. I would smile everyday as I got to work, joked with co-workers and call family members and friends to discuss everything and anything when deep down all I wanted to do was to crawl in a dark place and wallow in my sadness. This period led to a lot of physical and mental changes. I lost 20 pounds in 2 months due to stress but the vain person in me was happy to see myself get skinny. Mentally, I had to come clean to my family and explain to them how I became the first divorced person in a deeply catholic family. I created a smaller, more dependable community of friends, most of them divorced or separated who could provide me with a different perspective. I had to admit to my manager that I could not continue work as is. Maintaining the lies became exhausting and emotionally draining. One had to give and after a heart to heart with my manager, I decided to cash out all my vacation hours and head out to Southeast Asia for a month.</p>

<p>Prior to Southeast Asia, I had never vacationed alone. For the first time in my life, I was in charge of my itinerary and my own entertainment. It was overwhelming. After discussing the trip with veteran solo travelers, I only purchased one ticket. All I knew was my departing and arrival date from and to the US. I arrived at my first stop, Ho Chi Minh City, at midnight on a blazing hot night. The bustle of the city took me aback and made me question the trip in its entirety. I was running away and I knew it. I have always thought of myself as a strong person but dealing with this separation made me feel like a scared kid. Just as I was going through this mental exercise, my cab driver hit a motorcyclist and the impact broke one of his side view mirrors. The driver angrily got out of the car and argued with the individual he had just hit. They spoke in Vietnamese for what felt like hours and came back without explanations. At that point, I was sure that this entire trip was a mistake and if I had spoken the language, I would have asked the driver to turn and drop me back at the airport.</p>

<p>The rest of the drive to the hotel was much calmer with the occasional surprise looks from locals seeing a black tourist through a taxi window at midnight. Blame it on stress, jet lag or even regret but for the first time in months I slept for more than 4 hours. Somewhat invigorated by the night of sleep, I decided to venture into the city to find food. After multiple failed attempts to cross one of the main traffic arteries, I gave up and sat down miserably looking at a bowl of pho from a restaurant located in the same block as my hotel. The Ho Chi Minh City traffic had won once again. I sat by a window seat, staring into the street, dreading the rest of this Southeast Asia trip. To travel Asia required an adventure spirit and it only took me 2 days to recognize that this was not one of my hidden talents. I told myself, only half believing it, that my second stop might be different but deep down, I knew I was on my way to yet another disappointing time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/friends-trip-sleep.png" title="Screenshot of sleep activity during the trip." ></p>

<p>Bangkok was a life changing stop for my trip and myself as a person. I had contacted a Turkish-based traveler on CouchSurfing visiting Bangkok during the same time. I was excited to meet up with someone that could understand the struggles of being in an unfamiliar country. This guy learned English by watching American sitcoms but did not let his basic knowledge of English or his lack of Thai stop him. It led to some interesting conversations about the meaning of &ldquo;Netflix and Chill&rdquo; and other American colloquialisms. Seeing him tackle the challenges of navigating a foreign city showed me what my journey could look like. Not only did he help me see the wonders of being open to the world, but he also inadvertently started my process of self love. Let me explain. To avoid having to carry a heavy suitcase and pay airline fees, I limited my wardrobe to whatever could fit in a carry-on backpack. As a relatively fashion-focused person, this decision was uncomfortable. With that in mind and the unforgiving sun, I was either dripped in sweat or looking like a lost 1920s explorer. Having someone still think that I looked good in those conditions did wonders for my broken self esteem. We spend 4 adventures filled days and parted ways. We still talk to each other and I am grateful to have encountered him so early on during my trip. I finally embraced the lack of structure and decided to thrive through it. Remember this word &ldquo;Thrive&rdquo;, it will come back later on in this story.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/friends-trip-construction.jpg" title="Temple in Bangkok." ></p>

<p>After Bangkok, I headed to Chiang Mai for the Lantern Festival. Given my positive experience with CouchSurfing, I decided to continue using it  to meet locals and travelers throughout my stops. I used all the lessons learned in Bangkok and forced myself to open up to people. I had a heart wrenching conversation with an American girl trying to find herself in the world despite familial and societal pressures. We quickly bonded and within minutes were sharing our deepest darkest fears. In addition to looking differently at people, I started focusing on things that made me happy. I took a Thai cooking class, a skill I desperately lacked in, and learned Muay Thai. With each new activity I undertook, I felt a change inside of me. I was slowly starting to fall in love with myself.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/friends-trip-market.jpg" title="Cooking class in Chiang Mai." ></p>

<p>Next stop: Singapore. A few coworkers happened to be there around the same time and I had always been intrigued by the country. I experienced the country&rsquo;s renowned cleanliness, mix of cultures and wide array of food options. It was in Singapore that I learned another fact about myself: I loved meeting new people. I struck conversations with random people in elevators, buses or hotels. Not having an itinerary turned out to be a blessing. I ended up extending my time in Singapore and enjoyed some retail therapy from one of the cities&#8217; amazing malls.</p>

<p>My goal for this trip was not only self discovery but also to be fully emerged in each country’s history and culture. So that meant that I purposely landed in each new locations not knowing anything about religious beliefs, language and social norms. It worked in my favor up until I arrived in Kuala Lumpur. On my first day in the country, I had planned to follow my typical plan and visit the national and art museums to learn about Malaysian culture. Unfortunately, I arrived during yellow and red shirt protests. All local attractions were closed and I ended up smack in  a protest. While I am sure I was never in any real danger, being stuck in the middle of a screaming and upset group of people was scary. I took refuge in a nearby mall and ended up being stranded there for 4 hours. No taxis or Ubers wanted to come to my location due to road closures and fears of property damages. With each hour, I got more and more scared and worried. When I was finally able to get to my hotel, I made arrangements to leave the day after to go to Cambodia. I am hoping to go back to KL and get a chance to see all the city has to offer.</p>

<p>After my failure in Malaysia, I landed in Siem Reap defeated. Cambodia was breathtaking. It was the first time that I saw real poverty and luxury in the same location. It was in Siem Reap that I realized how small my problems really were. I saw and talked to people struggling to afford day to day life and here I was suffering from a broken heart. Siem Reap helped me refocus and gave me a different perspective. It wasn&rsquo;t about what my problems were but how I approached them. I was not as powerless as I thought I was. I could make the choice to not let my situations impact me and move forward. There, I met some of the most life-loving individuals. As we were exchanging travel stories and tips, we all realized that we were into the same type of music. One of the members of the group ran to his hotel room and brought back his turntables. We had an impromptu dance party in the middle of Siem Reap. I sang and danced my heart away to familiar songs in a an unfamiliar land with unfamiliar people. At that time, I realized that I was happy. For the first time in months, there were no hidden emotions behind my smile, it was pure happiness and I never wanted it to end.</p>

<p>I went to Angkor Wat at sunrise and felt lost and transported to a different world visiting all the cultural sites of the country. The Tuol Seng prison and the lives lost there forced me to put my life into perspective. I realized the following facts that I knew deep down but up until then was unwilling to accept: 1) I was getting divorced, 2) I was deeply hurt that I wasn&rsquo;t enough for my husband , 3) I still loved Carl and needed to respect his choice, 4) This was not the end for me. Weirdly, coming to these realizations made me calmer. I knew what I had to do. I had to use the remaining days of this trip to try to discover as much as I could about myself.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/friends-trip-skyline.jpg" title="Sunrise at Angkor Wat, Siem Reap." ></p>

<p>Along with self discovery and adventure-filled days came the not-so fun ones. Thanksgiving day landed while I was in Phnom Penh. As an immigrant, Thanksgiving meant spending time with Carl&rsquo;s family. Up until Thanksgiving day, I thought about Carl during my trip but never more than &ldquo;Carl would have loved eating this, or visiting this area or enjoyed talking with this individual&rdquo;. But as I was staring at my plate of mashed potatoes and turkey, I not only felt a overwhelming sense of loss but also felt shame. Only a few hours prior, I was reveling in the country&rsquo;s history and congratulating myself in having a fresh new perspective on life. I could not finish my plate and walked back to my hotel room beaten. For the first time since I started on this adventure, I was happy that I was traveling alone. I spent the rest of my day watching TV locked in my hotel room.</p>

<p>After 3 weeks on the road, I headed back to Vietnam for my last week abroad. For convenience, I reserved a room in the same hotel I had checked at the beginning of this trip. I suddenly realized that the person who checked in 3 weeks ago was not the person who was walking in. I couldn&rsquo;t put my finger on what it was specifically but I felt more confident and more at peace with myself. A former coworker traveling in Ho Chi Minh City at the same time reached out and we connected for dinner. His first words to me were &ldquo;&hellip; so, what is going on, where is your husband?&rdquo; We hadn&rsquo;t seen each other for 4 years and apparently, my social media accounts had become a &ldquo;Eat, Pray, Love&rdquo; tribute. I explained my current situation, no longer ashamed of the fact that I had a failed marriage, and we traded travel stories. He had not left his hotel room until our meeting because he was overwhelmed by the city, especially the traffic. I can&rsquo;t put into words how satisfying it was for me to be able to teach him how to cross the road. I fondly remembered my old self, seating defeated in front of a bowl of pho. I couldn&rsquo;t have engineered a better end to 4 wonderful weeks in paradise.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/friends-trip-boat.jpg" title="On the way to floating market in Can Tho, Vietnam." ></p>

<p>Of course I glanced over many more experiences, people and locations visited. It would take days to write it all. I came back to the US on a high that I knew would not last but I was determined to keep it as long as possible. I had felt true happiness and connected with new people for the first time in 7 months. I was accepted even after I showed my true, deeply flawed self, but most importantly, I met myself. I discovered the foundations of who I was, what made me smile, happy and tick. I realized that I could survive, not just survive, I could thrive in a foreign environment and to commemorate it, I tattooed “Thrive” on my shoulder to always remind myself of that feeling. Told you that word was going to come back.</p>

    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/prius-adventures-a-year-later</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s time to write more about my adventures. I&rsquo;ve been traveling and living in my car for nearly a year now, mostly full-time (excluding hotels on infrequent business trips, occasional friends&#8217; couches, or AirBnB a few times I was sick or wanted a home). I&rsquo;d love to share what I&rsquo;ve learned over the past year.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/camping-in-california.jpg" title="Camping in California." ></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how a typical conversation with someone who just learned I&rsquo;m living in my car goes:</p>

<h2>You live in <em>that?</em></h2>

<p>Yes I do. I think I need to start from the beginning.</p>

<p>About a year ago I wasn&rsquo;t in a very good place emotionally. I&rsquo;ve been going through a divorce, my dream company declined my job application (spoiler: I got the job this year, yay), and my landlord decided that 12 tiny houses on a property isn&rsquo;t enough and it&rsquo;s time to kick everyone out to build a more dense apartment complex. I didn&rsquo;t do much outside of going to work and sleeping.</p>

<p>I think I saw an opportunity to do something drastic with my life, and I decided to take a leap of faith. I gave away everything I couldn&rsquo;t fit in the back of the car, and set on a road trip across continental United States (after spending a month doing test drives and adjusting my setup dozens of times).</p>

<p>The experience turned out to be more enjoyable than having a house.</p>

<h2>How do you even fit in there?!</h2>

<p>Everyone I talk to thinks the space is really cramped up, and I have to sleep curled into a ball in the trunk (or something along those lines).</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/feet-under-blanket.jpg" title="Pictures make it look really cramped up, but it&rsquo;s rather spacious inside." ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m 5&#8217;11&#8221;, and I have a flat twin-width bed in that&rsquo;s around 7 feet long (it&rsquo;s been awhile since I measured). I sleep on an inflatable pad wrapped in a sleeping bag, on top of another sleeping bag all wrapped in a silk sleeping bag cover - my composite mattress is about 3 inches thick. I use regular blankets and pillows, adding or removing a few depending on the temperature outside.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most comfortable beds I&rsquo;ve ever slept on.</p>

<h2>Poor soul, want to crash on my couch?</h2>

<p>This is an offer I get as soon as somebody learns I&rsquo;m living in a car (it&rsquo;s right up there with &ldquo;You must be saving so much money not paying rent!&rdquo;). Most people are really nice, and offer a place to stay. I think it stems from an understandable notion that one probably would only live in a car because of being in a bad situation.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/inside-of-the-car-view-from-the-back.jpg" title="View of the bed from the back of the car." ></p>

<p>Oddly enough I really enjoy the lifestyle, and I always reject the offers (always appreciate them though). Sometimes I contemplate getting a small RV or a van, but I&rsquo;m way to attached to air conditioning on demand and 50 mpg on the highway. But I probably won&rsquo;t need to crash on your couch.</p>

<p>I think the TL;DR here is that majority of people are really nice, once you get out and get to interact with them enough.</p>

<h2>Why on Earth are you still living in a car?</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s more than one reason at this point. Part of it is that it has become a habit now. The biggest reason is probably all the fun things it has forced me to do.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve met a lot of cool people, tried out so many things I would&rsquo;ve never considered trying, and found exciting hobbies I would&rsquo;ve never had otherwise. I&rsquo;m also now in a great shape physically since I usually have to hit up the gym to shower.</p>

<p>It also made me confront my inner demons, since car living tends to consistently provide me with time to be alone with my thoughts - be it driving somewhere, or falling asleep in an area where I wouldn&rsquo;t want to use electronics. I feel more in tune with myself, and I can close my eyes without being afraid of stream of thoughts keeping me awake at night.</p>

<h2>That&rsquo;s cool! What else is inside?</h2>

<p><img src="/images/posts/before-and-after-bike-rack.jpg" title="Bike rack: before and after." ></p>

<h3>The front</h3>

<p>I try to keep driver&rsquo;s seat and front passenger seat area clean and empty, with storing some low key items in passenger seat leg space &ndash; portable 12V vacuum, water jug, water boiler/thermos.</p>

<p>The front seats are separated from the back by a dark curtain. Unless you shine a (powerful) flashlight inside a car it&rsquo;s almost impossible to tell the curtain is there.</p>

<h3>The back</h3>

<p><img src="/images/posts/window-cutout-from-the-inside.jpg" title="In addition to curtains I also have custom-made window cutouts." ></p>

<p>One of the passenger seats is lowered to make a bed. The bed is extended with a wooden panel specifically made for this purpose which creates a flat surface about 7 foot long. A mattress with a blanket and some throws creates /a nice homey look.</p>

<p>Under the bed is &ldquo;the basement&rdquo; &ndash; large clear container where I store winter clothes and things I rarely use. If I&rsquo;m camping extra water jugs go here as well. And some bicycle maintenance stuff, and extra pairs of shoes.</p>

<p>I use the other rear passenger seat as my primary relaxing area when I&rsquo;m inside the car. There&rsquo;s a little trashcan stuck to the floor in between the seats.</p>

<h3>Cargo and the bike</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s an old suitcase I use for organizing various cooking and camping supplies. It&rsquo;s split into nine compartments by some separators I&rsquo;ve put together. This is where I have some freeze dried veggies, spices, grains and pasta, cooking oils, camping pots and pans, equipment for cleaning the dishes, etc. On top of the suitcase is a backpack where I keep clothes. There&rsquo;s also a propane burner, camping table and a chair, as well as a toiletry kit. Dirty laundry goes in a dry bag.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/cooking-supplies-in-the-suitcase.jpg" title="Cooking supplies in a suitcase." ></p>

<p>I also have a bike strapped to the outside of the car, exploring places by bike after arriving to a new city is very rewarding!</p>

<h2>Isn&rsquo;t it dangerous?</h2>

<p>You often read stories of people suffocating in their own cars, and it&rsquo;s something to be aware of. There are a few rules I follow to be safe, and there are three main dangers here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Carbon monoxide poisoning.</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide poisoning.</li>
<li>Extreme temperatures.</li>
</ol>


<p>I sleep with carbon monoxide alarm not far from my head, and my car is a hybrid &ndash; meaning it only turns itself on once in a while when batteries need to be recharged. Sometimes I sleep with my car on, and sometimes not. The alarm never went off so far (it works, I check regularly).</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (stuff you exhale) poisoning is not a silent killer (unlike carbon monoxide), humans are pretty good at detecting high concentration of CO2 &ndash; panic attack on par with a headache are a rather clear sign of this happening. I keep windows cracked open most of the time, plus my AC is often on.</p>

<p>I love sleeping at low temperatures (50-60F is my comfort zone for snuggling up under a blanket), but if local forecast suggests the temperature will drop below 50F at night - I make sure to sleep with AC on. If it&rsquo;s below freezing - I roll up the windows, otherwise I still keep them cracked open a little.</p>

<p>And if it&rsquo;s really cold and I don&rsquo;t want to run AC all night, or I just feel like I want to stay inside for a bit - I can just get AirBnB for a couple of nights. Speaking of, by pure chance I stayed at Gayle Laakmann McDowell&rsquo;s guest house few weeks ago, and I left with great memories and a signed copy of Cracking the Code Interview. Bonus point for meeting cool people.</p>

<h2>How does Prius AC work anyway?</h2>

<p>This question pops up often enough to address here (along with condensation concerns from seasoned vandwellers).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a hybrid with two electric motors assisting the internal combustion engine. The electric motors power up from a ~1.3 kWh battery, which is recharged using the engine and regenerative brakes. That battery is connected to the 12V battery, and as long as there&rsquo;s gas in the car &ndash; both batteries will be charged. In practice, if the car isn&rsquo;t moving, engine turns on every half an hour or so for a little under a minute to recharge the batteries.</p>

<p>This allows one to keep the car on and use the AC throughout the night. AC also keeps the moisture level at bay, preventing condensation. I also noticed that when I don&rsquo;t use the AC cracked windows help with condensation (I have rain guards for stealth and keeping the rain out).</p>

<h2>Um, how do you do bathroom stuff?</h2>

<p>If we&rsquo;re talking about changing - there&rsquo;s plenty of space in the back of the car to change.</p>

<p>For hygiene - I use gym showers (I take quite a lot of classes), or wet wipes if I&rsquo;m out camping or shower is otherwise unavailable. I&rsquo;m now kind of an expert on all sorts of wipes. Any restroom works for brushing my teeth at night, and in US it&rsquo;s very difficult not to be within the vicinity of a public bathroom.</p>

<h2>Where do you park at night?</h2>

<p>Rest stops are the best when I travel, since everyone on a rest stop is just resting/sleeping in their car.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-lit-up-at-night.jpg" title="Christmas lights make inside more homey." ></p>

<p>There are so many places to park: since this is just a passenger car, anywhere where cars can park is good. Usually somewhere with either a lot of foot traffic (or the exact opposite). Parking lots of 24/7 business, residential areas, anywhere and anytime.</p>

<h2>What do your friends and coworkers say?</h2>

<p>Most colleagues and acquaintances don&rsquo;t know, since it&rsquo;s not really a topic that pops up during a normal conversation. I go to work and social events well groomed, with clean clothes, and (I&rsquo;d like to think) demonstrating a sense of style.</p>

<p>Few friends and colleagues that do know that I live in the car don&rsquo;t see it as anything out of the ordinary (past the initial shock of course). I can&rsquo;t remember the last time conversation got stirred towards car living with any of my close friends. A few are rather jealous but reluctant to make the move. I try not to preach.</p>

<p>My love life surprisingly didn&rsquo;t suffer. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I tend to pursue women just as odd as me, but me living in a car didn&rsquo;t have any negative effects, and even got me a date or two. If someone doesn&rsquo;t want to go out with you because of living arrangements - they would probably not make a good partner in a long run.</p>

<h2>Do strangers bother you?</h2>

<p>When you observe people you start noticing how much everyone&rsquo;s concerned with what people think of them. In fact, most people so concerned with themselves - that they don&rsquo;t look around. Encounters with people who notice I live in a car are nearly non-existent. Nobody cares to look inside one of the hundred cars in a parking lot or parked on the side of the street.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a few rather friendly encounters with parking lot security, with people usually just demonstrating concern. Until I share my setup that is, then concern is often replacement with mild jealousy.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/making-a-meal-at-a-rest-stop.jpg" title="I sometimes make meals at rest stops." ></p>

<p>Most encounters with strangers approaching me happen at rest stops, since I usually don&rsquo;t hide much &ndash; there are enough misfits and travelers. Every encounter like that I&rsquo;ve had was positive, with people commenting on how amazing my setup is, how they wished they could do a similar thing, or sharing a story about their own travels.</p>

<h2>How do you not go crazy?</h2>

<p>This is where the fun part starts. You see, the thing about living in the car is how boring it is. There&rsquo;s really not much you can do in a confined space. So I have to get out of my way to entertain myself.</p>

<p>I take a lot of classes like various martial arts or archery. I tried miniature painting, rock climbing, long distance cycling. There are numerous things I&rsquo;m &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to do in order to keep myself entertained.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things I do inside the car too. Writing or coding (even though I prefer coffee shops), rare indulgence in video games (I recently picked up a gaming laptop for this), guitalele (it&rsquo;s a ukulele-sized guitar), reading. Drawing, keeping a journal, or just relaxing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/laptop-hooked-up-to-the-headrest.jpg" title="I setup laptop at an eye level and use external keyboard." ></p>

<p>And of course there are people. When I travel I end up meeting a lot of different people. I often get invited to join somebody at a campsite, and we&rsquo;d cook a meal together or share some stories. Or somebody sitting next to me in a coffee shop works in the same industry and we grab lunch to mingle and share interesting ideas. Wherever I go I get lucky enough to make friends for a couple of minutes, hours, days, and sometimes months.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next for you?</h2>

<p>For now, I&rsquo;m used to living in a car. I sometimes pop by AirBnBs or friends&#8217; places for a couple of days, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say I enjoy being tied down to a single location for a long period of time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/cycling-by-the-ocean.jpg" title="Cycling on the West Coast is the best." ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m contemplating getting an RV to be able to stand up inside and have more room and privacy, but potential difficulties with air conditioning at night, atrocious gas mileage, and inefficient and noisy generators for my power usage are a concern of mine.</p>

<p>Once in a while I contemplate getting myself an apartment. Since it&rsquo;s now winter I end up staying in AirBnBs more often, but I feel like having a place to call home makes it harder for me to a fight a lazy person inside me. I like when that person is forced to learn, explore, and create.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I like traveling. I&rsquo;ve been living on the road on and off for the past half a year, traveling across the US. This whole time I live in my car, and quite frankly, I enjoy it.</p>

<p>Passing beautiful vistas and not having a place to call home are two sides of the same coin. It&rsquo;s something that gives me time to think.</p>

<p>From a very young age we surround ourselves with objects of comfort. It all starts with toys we have as children. First things we own. Our room. Friends. House. Job. Town. Country. We take comfort in certain parts of the environment. Be it objects, people, or places.</p>

<p>After getting rid of most of my belongings and starting my journey - I felt like a lot of things which made me feel comfortable and safe were gone. It made me feel very exposed to the world.</p>

<p>When objects of comfort are gone, one has to face a lot of their own demons. Issues hidden by a security blanket are let out to roam freely. Living on the road amplifies the experiences I have: the ups are high, and the downs are low. A wider specter of emotions is thrown onto me.</p>

<p>I guess there&rsquo;s a reason why majority of people all live in a similar manner. It&rsquo;s comforting. It&rsquo;s a void inside you that needs filling. It&rsquo;s things we don&rsquo;t want to think about, deal with.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s also strength in letting go. Items, places, people. Thoughts. Ideas. It&rsquo;s a way of growth. To become a better version of yourself, you need to be destroyed a little. Deal with the darkness within.</p>

<p>Some days it&rsquo;s exhausting, some days it&rsquo;s revitalizing. But that&rsquo;s why I do what I do.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have set on my journey across the United States and back a few months ago.
It&rsquo;s a fun thing to do, and really gave me a breath of fresh air. I watched
elephant seals and whales on a California coast, spent what felt like days
stuck in LA traffic, ran from a blizzard, made it through a flash flood, passed
a tornado, celebrated New Year&rsquo;s on the road&hellip;</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t let me get ahead of myself.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-with-the-hills-behind-it.jpg" title="Prius with a beautiful view on the hills behind it." ></p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s inside</h2>

<p>My path started in San Francisco Bay Area, a place I&rsquo;ve been lately calling
home. I tried out <a href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/urban-prius-living/">living out of a Prius</a> before, thus not having a sturdy
place to call home wasn&rsquo;t really a shock. After only a few weeks I didn&rsquo;t feel
like anything is out of place - being on a road feels just as normal as renting
a house.</p>

<h3>Living areas</h3>

<p>First - the packing and organization. Just like in any living space, zoning is
important. Space inside a car is separated into 5 major areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>A driver&rsquo;s seat, used solely for driving. No other activities are permitted,
and the less time is spent in the driving seat - the better. This helps one
to stay alert when on a road.</li>
<li>Front passenger seat. There&rsquo;s not enough room to sit here due to the seat
being moved to the front all the way (to give the most space for the bed). I
usually just keep a backpack here (which I always take with me, so this area
stays empty when I&rsquo;m not in the car).</li>
<li>Rear passenger seat behind a driver. This is a primary seat for activities -
reading, fiddling around with a laptop, having some tea or a snack. A cooler
is taking up the leg space, but it&rsquo;s never a problem: in the wilderness I put
it outside, and nine times out of ten I don&rsquo;t want to sit with my legs down
(since that&rsquo;s the position I drive in).</li>
<li>A bed. Level surface, approximately 6 and a half feet long. Sleeping mat,
winter queen sized sleeping bag folded in two as a second mattress, a summer
sleeping bag, two pillows, and a plaid on top (for added coziness).</li>
<li>Additional cargo storage under the bed. Water supply, out-of-season clothes,
shoes.</li>
<li>Cargo area in the rear. A suitcase with food and clothes, toiletry kit, and
miscellaneous stuff. Some things I don&rsquo;t access often are in a secondary cargo
compartment Prius has underneath the cargo surface.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/images/posts/view-of-prius-interior-from-the-rear.jpg" title="View of the car interior with the rear door open: suitcase on the left, and a bed on the right." ></p>

<p>After about a week, moving between the areas within a car becomes surprisingly
easy and natural. I usually put on a hand brake, lock the car, leave my shoes
in a driver&rsquo;s seat and move to the back sit or the bed.</p>

<h3>Food, water, and cooking</h3>

<p>Being prepared is essential for living on the road, so I keep a lot of food and
water in the car. I make it a rule of thumb to keep 6-8 3-liter water jugs in
the car, which amounts to 18-24 liters (5-6 gallons) of drinking water.</p>

<p>For boiling water I use <a href="http://amzn.to/1Pj5kpe">RoadPro Smart Car Pot</a>. I&rsquo;ll upgrade to something
better eventually, since it requires me to plan too far in advance - it takes
20-25 minutes to get water to boil.</p>

<p>I also have teabags and coffee with me. I used to have instant coffee, but it
tastes terrible compared to the real thing. Now I use a simple one-cup coffee
maker (the one where coffee drips through a funnel) to brew my pre-ground
coffee.</p>

<p>When it comes to food - I use rice, grains, and pasta as a base for some meals.
Canned goods like corn, peas, mixed veggies, pasta sauce, or chili add a nice
touch to the base. I heat up canned soups with a backpacking stove when I&rsquo;m not
in the mood for cooking whole meals or doing the dishes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/making-dinner-in-the-dark.jpg" title="Making dinner in the dark." ></p>

<p>I have a <a href="http://amzn.to/1Pj5BbN">16-qt Stanley Adventure Cooler</a> which keeps items inside cold for
nearly three days (or practically indefinitely if I&rsquo;m up in the mountains where
it&rsquo;s cold). When I&rsquo;m preparing to be out in the wild, I fill it up with eggs,
meat, cheese, veggies, fruits, and berries.</p>

<p>In addition to everything listed above I always carry 6 days worth of MREs and
water in an <a href="http://amzn.to/1meZgWz">emergency backpack</a> underneath in the cargo compartment in case
I am ever stranded somewhere.</p>

<h3>Washing the dishes</h3>

<p>For cleaning my cookware I&rsquo;m using a backpacking approach I&rsquo;ve read about on
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clean-Dishes-on-a-Camping-Trip#Spray_and_Wash_sub">WikiHow</a>. I spray the dishes with some natural cleaning solution, let them
sit for a bit, wipe it off with paper towels, and then thoroughly rinse
degreased dishes off in a 5-liter travel kitchen sink.</p>

<h3>Clothing</h3>

<p>Most of my clothing is pretty regular - pants, T-shirts, shirts, cardigans,
sweaters, jackets. However I did switch to using merino wool for all my base
layers: underwear, socks, compression tops and bottoms. While being
significantly more expensive, merino wool is much more comfortable to wear, and
it stays clean for much longer than normal clothes.</p>

<p>All the things I wear day to day fit in a backpack. When I stayed in New York
City for a few weeks without a car I had everything I needed in it:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/backpack-filled-with-stuff.jpg" title="Backpack filled with clothes." ></p>

<p>In addition to all of the above, I carry a few pairs of shoes and an additional
outer layer I wear when I anticipate to be near a campfire. That goes in a
storage bin under the bed.</p>

<h3>Laundry</h3>

<p>I started with visiting laundromats and just carrying a lot of coins with me.
But after a while, a number of items which require hand washing or delicate
care have increased - mostly due to above specified merino wool base layers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for an excuse to try out <a href="http://amzn.to/1QdUGjt">Scrubba wash bag</a> I&rsquo;ve heard so
much about - basically a dry sack for washing clothes. I found it to be quite
convenient and not at all cumbersome to use.</p>

<p>While I still use laundromats for washing bulkier items, I hand wash my easy to
clean and quick to dry base layers.</p>

<h3>Sleeping</h3>

<p>A self-inflating sleeping pad and a winter queen-sized sleeping bag folded in
half create a great mattress. I sleep in a summer sleeping bag, with an added
sleeping bag liner and a few travel pillows.</p>

<p>I run AC in the car throughout the night. While keeping the temperature
pleasant, it tends to dry out the air and results in a major case of a sore
throat in a morning. I use a small travel humidifier which connects to a USB
power supply to regulate the humidity in the car at night.</p>

<h3>Entertainment</h3>

<p>Boredom seems to never be a concern with this lifestyle. I use laptop for rare
acts of writing, and a Kindle for reading during the little downtime I have. I
also have a little harmonica I hope I&rsquo;ll learn to play one day. And some
juggling balls I throw around once in a while.</p>

<h2>A few words on stealth</h2>

<p>While I enjoy staying at campsites, a large portion of my journey involved
staying in urban areas. Looking inconspicious is a big deal when you&rsquo;re relaxing
in a car - it&rsquo;s not fun when somebody comes knocking on your door (didn&rsquo;t happen
to me though).</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/hiding-in-plain-sight.jpg" title="Hiding in plain sight between rental cars." ></p>

<p>The fact that it&rsquo;s a white-ish Prius helps a lot. Car dwelling is not a first
thing people think when they see a tiny city car parked on the side of the road.
Tinted windows (heavier tint in the rear, lighter in the front) are enough to
shield the dweller from the passers by. A blackout curtain separating the front
seats from the back area and covering rear windows is enough to cover one from
curious eyes peering inside the car.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the car looks in ful lighting with the curtains down, if you look
closely you can see the black fabric behind the seat backs. But most likely
you&rsquo;ll just pass the car:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-in-an-underground-parking-garage.jpg" title="Prius in an underground parking garage with the curtains down." ></p>

<p>Finding a place to stay boils down to four simple steps for me:</p>

<ol>
<li>Drive around in advance, find a place where it&rsquo;s easy to blend it. I prefer a
balance between empty and fully crowded lots. Avoid parking at a chosen area
until later in the evening.</li>
<li>Arrive late, hide in plain sight, park near similar cars. Don&rsquo;t tuck in
somewhere far and look suspicious.</li>
<li>Be respectful to whichever place you picked for the night. If possible, leave
it cleaner than it was when you arrived. Try not to be in and out of the car
too much either.</li>
<li>Leave early. Do not stay at one place multiple nights in a row. Avoid easily
recognizable patterns when returning to the same spot.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Final thoughts about my journey</h2>

<p>I traveled for an approximate of three weeks, and ended up hunkering down in New
York City for another month while leaving a car outside the city.</p>

<p>I gave up my apartment back in Bay Area for the duration of the travel, and it
feels liberating. It&rsquo;s comforting to know that one doesn&rsquo;t need to own a place
to live a happy and fulfilled life. Even further, living in NYC for weeks with a
single backpack worth of posessions and realising I don&rsquo;t need anything else was
an eye opening experience.</p>

<p>Turns out I really don&rsquo;t need much stuff to enjoy life.</p>

    <updated>2015-09-19T19:50:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/prius-camper-conversion</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As requested, I took some detailed pictures of the
<a href="http://amzn.to/1NvY78S">Prius Camper Conversion Kit</a> I mentioned in my <a href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/urban-prius-living">previous article</a>. It
adds valuable space to the back of the car when the seats are down, and helps to
push down the seats all the way in order to achieve a level surface. This
particular kit works for third generation of Prius, but can be slightly
modified to fit other models. In theory, something like this can work with any
car, as long as the rear seats can be forced down all the way to create a flat
surface (170 pounds of my bodyweight was enough to flatten out the seat back).</p>

<p>This is how the final conversion looks, with a mat cut to a custom shape on top
of it:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-final.jpg" title="This is how the final conversion looks." ></p>

<p>A wooden platform which is used to fill up rear leg space. Notice the blue
strap on the rear seat, that&rsquo;s what pushes down the seat to create a level
surface:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-with-the-mat-up.jpg" title="Wooden surface underneath the mat." ></p>

<p>The lid can be removed for storage space access:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-with-the-lid-off.jpg" title="Wooden platform with the lid off." ></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a relatively thin wooden platform. Top (on the picture) side of it is a
bit slanted to fit on a rear seat back:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-wooden-platform-top.jpg" title="Top view of the wooden platform." ></p>

<p>View from the bottom: metal pieces are there to hold platform legs when the
platform is not in use, but I don&rsquo;t find them necessary. Additional (darker)
piece of wood is what the lid rests on:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-wooden-platform-bottom.jpg" title="Bottom view of the wooden platform." ></p>

<p>View from the side:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-wooden-platform-side.jpg" title="Side view of the wooden platform." ></p>

<p>With passenger front seat pushed all the way forward (and seat back in further
possible forward position), wooden supports are inserted into exposed seat
railing. I added some duct tape layers at the bottom of each leg so that they
don&rsquo;t wobble when the wooden platform is removed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-wooden-legs.jpg" title="Wooden supports for the platform." ></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a right leg:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-wooden-legs-right.jpg" title="Right wooden support." ></p>

<p>I noticed that the left leg needed to be approximately 5 mm longer in order for
the platform not to wobble, so I extended it with whatever I had on hand:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-wooden-legs-left.jpg" title="Left wooden support." ></p>

<p>Adjustable belt with a hook on one side and a strap tie on the other:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-belt-with-a-hook.jpg" title="Belt with a hook." ></p>

<p>On the back side of rear seats there are places to secure a baby seat. I removed
the plastic covers (use some force), and attached a strap there. I added a piece
of cloth to (hopefully) prevent damage to seat fabric:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-belt-on-the-rear-seat.jpg" title="Belt on the rear seat." ></p>

<p>Tricky part is getting the bottom hook in the right place. Rear seats are held
in place by two metal locks. If you grab a rear seat from the bottom (when the
back is not folded) and pull up with approximately 50-100 pounds of force, the
seat will snap out of the place exposing the lock. Attach a hook to the exposed
part of the locking mechanism. Jump down on a seat to snap the rear seat back in
place. Exercise caution while you make your way through this, took me nearly an
hour to figure out how to properly attach a hook and snap the seat back in
place:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-bottom-hook.jpg" title="Bottom hook on the belt." ></p>

<p>When both sides of the belt are in place, fold the rear seat, push in down with
your body weight, and tighten the belt.</p>
