    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s time to write more about my adventures. I&rsquo;ve been traveling and living in my car for nearly a year now, mostly full-time (excluding hotels on infrequent business trips, occasional friends&#8217; couches, or AirBnB a few times I was sick or wanted a home). I&rsquo;d love to share what I&rsquo;ve learned over the past year.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/camping-in-california.jpg" title="Camping in California." ></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how a typical conversation with someone who just learned I&rsquo;m living in my car goes:</p>

<h2>You live in <em>that?</em></h2>

<p>Yes I do. I think I need to start from the beginning.</p>

<p>About a year ago I wasn&rsquo;t in a very good place emotionally. I&rsquo;ve been going through a divorce, my dream company declined my job application (spoiler: I got the job this year, yay), and my landlord decided that 12 tiny houses on a property isn&rsquo;t enough and it&rsquo;s time to kick everyone out to build a more dense apartment complex. I didn&rsquo;t do much outside of going to work and sleeping.</p>

<p>I think I saw an opportunity to do something drastic with my life, and I decided to take a leap of faith. I gave away everything I couldn&rsquo;t fit in the back of the car, and set on a road trip across continental United States (after spending a month doing test drives and adjusting my setup dozens of times).</p>

<p>The experience turned out to be more enjoyable than having a house.</p>

<h2>How do you even fit in there?!</h2>

<p>Everyone I talk to thinks the space is really cramped up, and I have to sleep curled into a ball in the trunk (or something along those lines).</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/feet-under-blanket.jpg" title="Pictures make it look really cramped up, but it&rsquo;s rather spacious inside." ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m 5&#8217;11&#8221;, and I have a flat twin-width bed in that&rsquo;s around 7 feet long (it&rsquo;s been awhile since I measured). I sleep on an inflatable pad wrapped in a sleeping bag, on top of another sleeping bag all wrapped in a silk sleeping bag cover - my composite mattress is about 3 inches thick. I use regular blankets and pillows, adding or removing a few depending on the temperature outside.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most comfortable beds I&rsquo;ve ever slept on.</p>

<h2>Poor soul, want to crash on my couch?</h2>

<p>This is an offer I get as soon as somebody learns I&rsquo;m living in a car (it&rsquo;s right up there with &ldquo;You must be saving so much money not paying rent!&rdquo;). Most people are really nice, and offer a place to stay. I think it stems from an understandable notion that one probably would only live in a car because of being in a bad situation.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/inside-of-the-car-view-from-the-back.jpg" title="View of the bed from the back of the car." ></p>

<p>Oddly enough I really enjoy the lifestyle, and I always reject the offers (always appreciate them though). Sometimes I contemplate getting a small RV or a van, but I&rsquo;m way to attached to air conditioning on demand and 50 mpg on the highway. But I probably won&rsquo;t need to crash on your couch.</p>

<p>I think the TL;DR here is that majority of people are really nice, once you get out and get to interact with them enough.</p>

<h2>Why on Earth are you still living in a car?</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s more than one reason at this point. Part of it is that it has become a habit now. The biggest reason is probably all the fun things it has forced me to do.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve met a lot of cool people, tried out so many things I would&rsquo;ve never considered trying, and found exciting hobbies I would&rsquo;ve never had otherwise. I&rsquo;m also now in a great shape physically since I usually have to hit up the gym to shower.</p>

<p>It also made me confront my inner demons, since car living tends to consistently provide me with time to be alone with my thoughts - be it driving somewhere, or falling asleep in an area where I wouldn&rsquo;t want to use electronics. I feel more in tune with myself, and I can close my eyes without being afraid of stream of thoughts keeping me awake at night.</p>

<h2>That&rsquo;s cool! What else is inside?</h2>

<p><img src="/images/posts/before-and-after-bike-rack.jpg" title="Bike rack: before and after." ></p>

<h3>The front</h3>

<p>I try to keep driver&rsquo;s seat and front passenger seat area clean and empty, with storing some low key items in passenger seat leg space &ndash; portable 12V vacuum, water jug, water boiler/thermos.</p>

<p>The front seats are separated from the back by a dark curtain. Unless you shine a (powerful) flashlight inside a car it&rsquo;s almost impossible to tell the curtain is there.</p>

<h3>The back</h3>

<p><img src="/images/posts/window-cutout-from-the-inside.jpg" title="In addition to curtains I also have custom-made window cutouts." ></p>

<p>One of the passenger seats is lowered to make a bed. The bed is extended with a wooden panel specifically made for this purpose which creates a flat surface about 7 foot long. A mattress with a blanket and some throws creates /a nice homey look.</p>

<p>Under the bed is &ldquo;the basement&rdquo; &ndash; large clear container where I store winter clothes and things I rarely use. If I&rsquo;m camping extra water jugs go here as well. And some bicycle maintenance stuff, and extra pairs of shoes.</p>

<p>I use the other rear passenger seat as my primary relaxing area when I&rsquo;m inside the car. There&rsquo;s a little trashcan stuck to the floor in between the seats.</p>

<h3>Cargo and the bike</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s an old suitcase I use for organizing various cooking and camping supplies. It&rsquo;s split into nine compartments by some separators I&rsquo;ve put together. This is where I have some freeze dried veggies, spices, grains and pasta, cooking oils, camping pots and pans, equipment for cleaning the dishes, etc. On top of the suitcase is a backpack where I keep clothes. There&rsquo;s also a propane burner, camping table and a chair, as well as a toiletry kit. Dirty laundry goes in a dry bag.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/cooking-supplies-in-the-suitcase.jpg" title="Cooking supplies in a suitcase." ></p>

<p>I also have a bike strapped to the outside of the car, exploring places by bike after arriving to a new city is very rewarding!</p>

<h2>Isn&rsquo;t it dangerous?</h2>

<p>You often read stories of people suffocating in their own cars, and it&rsquo;s something to be aware of. There are a few rules I follow to be safe, and there are three main dangers here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Carbon monoxide poisoning.</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide poisoning.</li>
<li>Extreme temperatures.</li>
</ol>


<p>I sleep with carbon monoxide alarm not far from my head, and my car is a hybrid &ndash; meaning it only turns itself on once in a while when batteries need to be recharged. Sometimes I sleep with my car on, and sometimes not. The alarm never went off so far (it works, I check regularly).</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (stuff you exhale) poisoning is not a silent killer (unlike carbon monoxide), humans are pretty good at detecting high concentration of CO2 &ndash; panic attack on par with a headache are a rather clear sign of this happening. I keep windows cracked open most of the time, plus my AC is often on.</p>

<p>I love sleeping at low temperatures (50-60F is my comfort zone for snuggling up under a blanket), but if local forecast suggests the temperature will drop below 50F at night - I make sure to sleep with AC on. If it&rsquo;s below freezing - I roll up the windows, otherwise I still keep them cracked open a little.</p>

<p>And if it&rsquo;s really cold and I don&rsquo;t want to run AC all night, or I just feel like I want to stay inside for a bit - I can just get AirBnB for a couple of nights. Speaking of, by pure chance I stayed at Gayle Laakmann McDowell&rsquo;s guest house few weeks ago, and I left with great memories and a signed copy of Cracking the Code Interview. Bonus point for meeting cool people.</p>

<h2>How does Prius AC work anyway?</h2>

<p>This question pops up often enough to address here (along with condensation concerns from seasoned vandwellers).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a hybrid with two electric motors assisting the internal combustion engine. The electric motors power up from a ~1.3 kWh battery, which is recharged using the engine and regenerative brakes. That battery is connected to the 12V battery, and as long as there&rsquo;s gas in the car &ndash; both batteries will be charged. In practice, if the car isn&rsquo;t moving, engine turns on every half an hour or so for a little under a minute to recharge the batteries.</p>

<p>This allows one to keep the car on and use the AC throughout the night. AC also keeps the moisture level at bay, preventing condensation. I also noticed that when I don&rsquo;t use the AC cracked windows help with condensation (I have rain guards for stealth and keeping the rain out).</p>

<h2>Um, how do you do bathroom stuff?</h2>

<p>If we&rsquo;re talking about changing - there&rsquo;s plenty of space in the back of the car to change.</p>

<p>For hygiene - I use gym showers (I take quite a lot of classes), or wet wipes if I&rsquo;m out camping or shower is otherwise unavailable. I&rsquo;m now kind of an expert on all sorts of wipes. Any restroom works for brushing my teeth at night, and in US it&rsquo;s very difficult not to be within the vicinity of a public bathroom.</p>

<h2>Where do you park at night?</h2>

<p>Rest stops are the best when I travel, since everyone on a rest stop is just resting/sleeping in their car.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-lit-up-at-night.jpg" title="Christmas lights make inside more homey." ></p>

<p>There are so many places to park: since this is just a passenger car, anywhere where cars can park is good. Usually somewhere with either a lot of foot traffic (or the exact opposite). Parking lots of 24/7 business, residential areas, anywhere and anytime.</p>

<h2>What do your friends and coworkers say?</h2>

<p>Most colleagues and acquaintances don&rsquo;t know, since it&rsquo;s not really a topic that pops up during a normal conversation. I go to work and social events well groomed, with clean clothes, and (I&rsquo;d like to think) demonstrating a sense of style.</p>

<p>Few friends and colleagues that do know that I live in the car don&rsquo;t see it as anything out of the ordinary (past the initial shock of course). I can&rsquo;t remember the last time conversation got stirred towards car living with any of my close friends. A few are rather jealous but reluctant to make the move. I try not to preach.</p>

<p>My love life surprisingly didn&rsquo;t suffer. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I tend to pursue women just as odd as me, but me living in a car didn&rsquo;t have any negative effects, and even got me a date or two. If someone doesn&rsquo;t want to go out with you because of living arrangements - they would probably not make a good partner in a long run.</p>

<h2>Do strangers bother you?</h2>

<p>When you observe people you start noticing how much everyone&rsquo;s concerned with what people think of them. In fact, most people so concerned with themselves - that they don&rsquo;t look around. Encounters with people who notice I live in a car are nearly non-existent. Nobody cares to look inside one of the hundred cars in a parking lot or parked on the side of the street.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a few rather friendly encounters with parking lot security, with people usually just demonstrating concern. Until I share my setup that is, then concern is often replacement with mild jealousy.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/making-a-meal-at-a-rest-stop.jpg" title="I sometimes make meals at rest stops." ></p>

<p>Most encounters with strangers approaching me happen at rest stops, since I usually don&rsquo;t hide much &ndash; there are enough misfits and travelers. Every encounter like that I&rsquo;ve had was positive, with people commenting on how amazing my setup is, how they wished they could do a similar thing, or sharing a story about their own travels.</p>

<h2>How do you not go crazy?</h2>

<p>This is where the fun part starts. You see, the thing about living in the car is how boring it is. There&rsquo;s really not much you can do in a confined space. So I have to get out of my way to entertain myself.</p>

<p>I take a lot of classes like various martial arts or archery. I tried miniature painting, rock climbing, long distance cycling. There are numerous things I&rsquo;m &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to do in order to keep myself entertained.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things I do inside the car too. Writing or coding (even though I prefer coffee shops), rare indulgence in video games (I recently picked up a gaming laptop for this), guitalele (it&rsquo;s a ukulele-sized guitar), reading. Drawing, keeping a journal, or just relaxing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/laptop-hooked-up-to-the-headrest.jpg" title="I setup laptop at an eye level and use external keyboard." ></p>

<p>And of course there are people. When I travel I end up meeting a lot of different people. I often get invited to join somebody at a campsite, and we&rsquo;d cook a meal together or share some stories. Or somebody sitting next to me in a coffee shop works in the same industry and we grab lunch to mingle and share interesting ideas. Wherever I go I get lucky enough to make friends for a couple of minutes, hours, days, and sometimes months.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next for you?</h2>

<p>For now, I&rsquo;m used to living in a car. I sometimes pop by AirBnBs or friends&#8217; places for a couple of days, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say I enjoy being tied down to a single location for a long period of time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/cycling-by-the-ocean.jpg" title="Cycling on the West Coast is the best." ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m contemplating getting an RV to be able to stand up inside and have more room and privacy, but potential difficulties with air conditioning at night, atrocious gas mileage, and inefficient and noisy generators for my power usage are a concern of mine.</p>

<p>Once in a while I contemplate getting myself an apartment. Since it&rsquo;s now winter I end up staying in AirBnBs more often, but I feel like having a place to call home makes it harder for me to a fight a lazy person inside me. I like when that person is forced to learn, explore, and create.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I like traveling. I&rsquo;ve been living on the road on and off for the past half a year, traveling across the US. This whole time I live in my car, and quite frankly, I enjoy it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/colorado-mountains.jpg" title="View of the highway leading to Colorado mountains.." ></p>

<p>Passing beautiful vistas and not having a place to call home are two sides of the same coin. It&rsquo;s something that gives me time to think.</p>

<p>From a very young age we surround ourselves with objects of comfort. It all starts with toys we have as children. First things we own. Our room. Friends. House. Job. Town. Country. We take comfort in certain parts of the environment. Be it objects, people, or places.</p>

<p>After getting rid of most of my belongings and starting my journey - I felt like a lot of things which made me feel comfortable and safe were gone. It made me feel very exposed to the world.</p>

<p>When objects of comfort are gone, one has to face a lot of their own demons. Issues hidden by a security blanket are let out to roam freely. Living on the road amplifies the experiences I have: the ups are high, and the downs are low. A wider specter of emotions is thrown onto me.</p>

<p>I guess there&rsquo;s a reason why majority of people all live in a similar manner. It&rsquo;s comforting. It&rsquo;s a void inside you that needs filling. It&rsquo;s things we don&rsquo;t want to think about, deal with.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s also strength in letting go. Items, places, people. Thoughts. Ideas. It&rsquo;s a way of growth. To become a better version of yourself, you need to be destroyed a little. Deal with the darkness within.</p>

<p>Some days it&rsquo;s exhausting, some days it&rsquo;s revitalizing. But that&rsquo;s why I do what I do.</p>

    <updated>2016-02-22T16:27:52+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/living-in-a-car-for-5000-miles</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have set on my journey across the United States and back a few months ago.
It&rsquo;s a fun thing to do, and really gave me a breath of fresh air. I watched
elephant seals and whales on a California coast, spent what felt like days
stuck in LA traffic, ran from a blizzard, made it through a flash flood, passed
a tornado, celebrated New Year&rsquo;s on the road&hellip;</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t let me get ahead of myself.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-with-the-hills-behind-it.jpg" title="Prius with a beautiful view on the hills behind it." ></p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s inside</h2>

<p>My path started in San Francisco Bay Area, a place I&rsquo;ve been lately calling
home. I tried out <a href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/urban-prius-living/">living out of a Prius</a> before, thus not having a sturdy
place to call home wasn&rsquo;t really a shock. After only a few weeks I didn&rsquo;t feel
like anything is out of place - being on a road feels just as normal as renting
a house.</p>

<h3>Living areas</h3>

<p>First - the packing and organization. Just like in any living space, zoning is
important. Space inside a car is separated into 5 major areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>A driver&rsquo;s seat, used solely for driving. No other activities are permitted,
and the less time is spent in the driving seat - the better. This helps one
to stay alert when on a road.</li>
<li>Front passenger seat. There&rsquo;s not enough room to sit here due to the seat
being moved to the front all the way (to give the most space for the bed). I
usually just keep a backpack here (which I always take with me, so this area
stays empty when I&rsquo;m not in the car).</li>
<li>Rear passenger seat behind a driver. This is a primary seat for activities -
reading, fiddling around with a laptop, having some tea or a snack. A cooler
is taking up the leg space, but it&rsquo;s never a problem: in the wilderness I put
it outside, and nine times out of ten I don&rsquo;t want to sit with my legs down
(since that&rsquo;s the position I drive in).</li>
<li>A bed. Level surface, approximately 6 and a half feet long. Sleeping mat,
winter queen sized sleeping bag folded in two as a second mattress, a summer
sleeping bag, two pillows, and a plaid on top (for added coziness).</li>
<li>Additional cargo storage under the bed. Water supply, out-of-season clothes,
shoes.</li>
<li>Cargo area in the rear. A suitcase with food and clothes, toiletry kit, and
miscellaneous stuff. Some things I don&rsquo;t access often are in a secondary cargo
compartment Prius has underneath the cargo surface.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/images/posts/view-of-prius-interior-from-the-rear.jpg" title="View of the car interior with the rear door open: suitcase on the left, and a bed on the right." ></p>

<p>After about a week, moving between the areas within a car becomes surprisingly
easy and natural. I usually put on a hand brake, lock the car, leave my shoes
in a driver&rsquo;s seat and move to the back sit or the bed.</p>

<h3>Food, water, and cooking</h3>

<p>Being prepared is essential for living on the road, so I keep a lot of food and
water in the car. I make it a rule of thumb to keep 6-8 3-liter water jugs in
the car, which amounts to 18-24 liters (5-6 gallons) of drinking water.</p>

<p>For boiling water I use <a href="http://amzn.to/1Pj5kpe">RoadPro Smart Car Pot</a>. I&rsquo;ll upgrade to something
better eventually, since it requires me to plan too far in advance - it takes
20-25 minutes to get water to boil.</p>

<p>I also have teabags and coffee with me. I used to have instant coffee, but it
tastes terrible compared to the real thing. Now I use a simple one-cup coffee
maker (the one where coffee drips through a funnel) to brew my pre-ground
coffee.</p>

<p>When it comes to food - I use rice, grains, and pasta as a base for some meals.
Canned goods like corn, peas, mixed veggies, pasta sauce, or chili add a nice
touch to the base. I heat up canned soups with a backpacking stove when I&rsquo;m not
in the mood for cooking whole meals or doing the dishes.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/making-dinner-in-the-dark.jpg" title="Making dinner in the dark." ></p>

<p>I have a <a href="http://amzn.to/1Pj5BbN">16-qt Stanley Adventure Cooler</a> which keeps items inside cold for
nearly three days (or practically indefinitely if I&rsquo;m up in the mountains where
it&rsquo;s cold). When I&rsquo;m preparing to be out in the wild, I fill it up with eggs,
meat, cheese, veggies, fruits, and berries.</p>

<p>In addition to everything listed above I always carry 6 days worth of MREs and
water in an <a href="http://amzn.to/1meZgWz">emergency backpack</a> underneath in the cargo compartment in case
I am ever stranded somewhere.</p>

<h3>Washing the dishes</h3>

<p>For cleaning my cookware I&rsquo;m using a backpacking approach I&rsquo;ve read about on
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clean-Dishes-on-a-Camping-Trip#Spray_and_Wash_sub">WikiHow</a>. I spray the dishes with some natural cleaning solution, let them
sit for a bit, wipe it off with paper towels, and then thoroughly rinse
degreased dishes off in a 5-liter travel kitchen sink.</p>

<h3>Clothing</h3>

<p>Most of my clothing is pretty regular - pants, T-shirts, shirts, cardigans,
sweaters, jackets. However I did switch to using merino wool for all my base
layers: underwear, socks, compression tops and bottoms. While being
significantly more expensive, merino wool is much more comfortable to wear, and
it stays clean for much longer than normal clothes.</p>

<p>All the things I wear day to day fit in a backpack. When I stayed in New York
City for a few weeks without a car I had everything I needed in it:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/backpack-filled-with-stuff.jpg" title="Backpack filled with clothes." ></p>

<p>In addition to all of the above, I carry a few pairs of shoes and an additional
outer layer I wear when I anticipate to be near a campfire. That goes in a
storage bin under the bed.</p>

<h3>Laundry</h3>

<p>I started with visiting laundromats and just carrying a lot of coins with me.
But after a while, a number of items which require hand washing or delicate
care have increased - mostly due to above specified merino wool base layers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for an excuse to try out <a href="http://amzn.to/1QdUGjt">Scrubba wash bag</a> I&rsquo;ve heard so
much about - basically a dry sack for washing clothes. I found it to be quite
convenient and not at all cumbersome to use.</p>

<p>While I still use laundromats for washing bulkier items, I hand wash my easy to
clean and quick to dry base layers.</p>

<h3>Sleeping</h3>

<p>A self-inflating sleeping pad and a winter queen-sized sleeping bag folded in
half create a great mattress. I sleep in a summer sleeping bag, with an added
sleeping bag liner and a few travel pillows.</p>

<p>I run AC in the car throughout the night. While keeping the temperature
pleasant, it tends to dry out the air and results in a major case of a sore
throat in a morning. I use a small travel humidifier which connects to a USB
power supply to regulate the humidity in the car at night.</p>

<h3>Entertainment</h3>

<p>Boredom seems to never be a concern with this lifestyle. I use laptop for rare
acts of writing, and a Kindle for reading during the little downtime I have. I
also have a little harmonica I hope I&rsquo;ll learn to play one day. And some
juggling balls I throw around once in a while.</p>

<h2>A few words on stealth</h2>

<p>While I enjoy staying at campsites, a large portion of my journey involved
staying in urban areas. Looking inconspicious is a big deal when you&rsquo;re relaxing
in a car - it&rsquo;s not fun when somebody comes knocking on your door (didn&rsquo;t happen
to me though).</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/hiding-in-plain-sight.jpg" title="Hiding in plain sight between rental cars." ></p>

<p>The fact that it&rsquo;s a white-ish Prius helps a lot. Car dwelling is not a first
thing people think when they see a tiny city car parked on the side of the road.
Tinted windows (heavier tint in the rear, lighter in the front) are enough to
shield the dweller from the passers by. A blackout curtain separating the front
seats from the back area and covering rear windows is enough to cover one from
curious eyes peering inside the car.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the car looks in ful lighting with the curtains down, if you look
closely you can see the black fabric behind the seat backs. But most likely
you&rsquo;ll just pass the car:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-in-an-underground-parking-garage.jpg" title="Prius in an underground parking garage with the curtains down." ></p>

<p>Finding a place to stay boils down to four simple steps for me:</p>

<ol>
<li>Drive around in advance, find a place where it&rsquo;s easy to blend it. I prefer a
balance between empty and fully crowded lots. Avoid parking at a chosen area
until later in the evening.</li>
<li>Arrive late, hide in plain sight, park near similar cars. Don&rsquo;t tuck in
somewhere far and look suspicious.</li>
<li>Be respectful to whichever place you picked for the night. If possible, leave
it cleaner than it was when you arrived. Try not to be in and out of the car
too much either.</li>
<li>Leave early. Do not stay at one place multiple nights in a row. Avoid easily
recognizable patterns when returning to the same spot.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Final thoughts about my journey</h2>

<p>I traveled for an approximate of three weeks, and ended up hunkering down in New
York City for another month while leaving a car outside the city.</p>

<p>I gave up my apartment back in Bay Area for the duration of the travel, and it
feels liberating. It&rsquo;s comforting to know that one doesn&rsquo;t need to own a place
to live a happy and fulfilled life. Even further, living in NYC for weeks with a
single backpack worth of posessions and realising I don&rsquo;t need anything else was
an eye opening experience.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/beautiful-vista.jpg" title="Beautiful vistas I wake up to." ></p>

<p>Turns out I really don&rsquo;t need much stuff to enjoy life.</p>

    <updated>2015-09-19T19:50:01+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/prius-camper-conversion</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As requested, I took some detailed pictures of the
<a href="http://amzn.to/1NvY78S">Prius Camper Conversion Kit</a> I mentioned in my <a href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/urban-prius-living">previous article</a>. It
adds valuable space to the back of the car when the seats are down, and helps to
push down the seats all the way in order to achieve a level surface. This
particular kit works for third generation of Prius, but can be slightly
modified to fit other models. In theory, something like this can work with any
car, as long as the rear seats can be forced down all the way to create a flat
surface (170 pounds of my bodyweight was enough to flatten out the seat back).</p>

<p>This is how the final conversion looks, with a mat cut to a custom shape on top
of it:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-final.jpg" title="This is how the final conversion looks." ></p>

<p>A wooden platform which is used to fill up rear leg space. Notice the blue
strap on the rear seat, that&rsquo;s what pushes down the seat to create a level
surface:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-with-the-mat-up.jpg" title="Wooden surface underneath the mat." ></p>

<p>The lid can be removed for storage space access:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-with-the-lid-off.jpg" title="Wooden platform with the lid off." ></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a relatively thin wooden platform. Top (on the picture) side of it is a
bit slanted to fit on a rear seat back:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-wooden-platform-top.jpg" title="Top view of the wooden platform." ></p>

<p>View from the bottom: metal pieces are there to hold platform legs when the
platform is not in use, but I don&rsquo;t find them necessary. Additional (darker)
piece of wood is what the lid rests on:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-wooden-platform-bottom.jpg" title="Bottom view of the wooden platform." ></p>

<p>View from the side:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-wooden-platform-side.jpg" title="Side view of the wooden platform." ></p>

<p>With passenger front seat pushed all the way forward (and seat back in further
possible forward position), wooden supports are inserted into exposed seat
railing. I added some duct tape layers at the bottom of each leg so that they
don&rsquo;t wobble when the wooden platform is removed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-wooden-legs.jpg" title="Wooden supports for the platform." ></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a right leg:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-wooden-legs-right.jpg" title="Right wooden support." ></p>

<p>I noticed that the left leg needed to be approximately 5 mm longer in order for
the platform not to wobble, so I extended it with whatever I had on hand:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-wooden-legs-left.jpg" title="Left wooden support." ></p>

<p>Adjustable belt with a hook on one side and a strap tie on the other:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-belt-with-a-hook.jpg" title="Belt with a hook." ></p>

<p>On the back side of rear seats there are places to secure a baby seat. I removed
the plastic covers (use some force), and attached a strap there. I added a piece
of cloth to (hopefully) prevent damage to seat fabric:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-belt-on-the-rear-seat.jpg" title="Belt on the rear seat." ></p>

<p>Tricky part is getting the bottom hook in the right place. Rear seats are held
in place by two metal locks. If you grab a rear seat from the bottom (when the
back is not folded) and pull up with approximately 50-100 pounds of force, the
seat will snap out of the place exposing the lock. Attach a hook to the exposed
part of the locking mechanism. Jump down on a seat to snap the rear seat back in
place. Exercise caution while you make your way through this, took me nearly an
hour to figure out how to properly attach a hook and snap the seat back in
place:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-camper-bottom-hook.jpg" title="Bottom hook on the belt." ></p>

<p>When both sides of the belt are in place, fold the rear seat, push in down with
your body weight, and tighten the belt.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not so long ago I stumbled upon a blog titled <a href="https://chrissawey.wordpress.com/">&ldquo;Hotel Prius&rdquo;</a>, and I loved
the idea. Being a Prius owner myself, I decided to give Prius living a test run.
Being cautious person I am, I decided to give it a test run for a week in a
familiar area.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-in-a-corporate-area.jpg" title="A Prius." ></p>

<h2>Preparing for the journey</h2>

<p>First, I decided to tint my windows. In addition to making a Prius look much
more pleasant, it keeps the car cooler throughout the day, and most importantly
makes it hard to peek inside the car. Especially at night.</p>

<p>Next, I ordered a <a href="http://amzn.to/1NvY78S">Prius Gen III Camping Sleeper Conversion Kit</a>. It&rsquo;s just a
fancy name for two belts to push down the rear seats, and two wooden platforms
with detachable feet to cover leg space. And two custom cut carpet runners to
cover up the panels. Nothing one can&rsquo;t make in their own garage, if the money is
tight.</p>

<p>The kit requires front seats to be locked in the furthest possible position,
rendering them unusable. So I only installed a panel behind a passenger seat.
With the panel installed, I have nearly 7 feet of level surface to sleep on.</p>

<p>Another problem with the kit is that it blocks the console from being opened
(arm rest storage between driver and passenger seat). I stopped using console as
a quick access box, and it doesn&rsquo;t feel like a big loss.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-sleeping-platform.jpg" title="Sleeping platform. Laundry bag at the bottom." ></p>

<p>I packed all my clothes in a duffle bag, bought a small toiletries kit, and put
the rest of my belongings in a backpack. Queen-sized sleeping bag I had came in
handy as a bed (with a couple of travel pillows).</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-duffle-bag-and-a-sleeping-bag.jpg" title="Duffle bag with clothes and a sleeping bag." ></p>

<p>After a second night I swapped my sleeping bag with a lighter and more compact
summer sleeping bag. That&rsquo;s also when I added a 1.5 inch sleeping pad to my
inventory.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-in-a-sleeping-position.jpg" title="Prius in a sleeping position, with toiletries kit and a duffle bag on the left, sleeping bag on the right." ></p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-bed-view-from-drivers-seat.jpg" title="View of a bed from the driver&rsquo;s seat." ></p>

<p>My backpack/briefcase is on the passenger&rsquo;s seat, I always take it with me.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-backpack-on-the-front-seat.jpg" title="Backpack on the passenger seat." ></p>

<p>In addition to all of the above, I took my guitar - even though it&rsquo;s bigger than
anything else I had to take with me, it&rsquo;s a great source of entertainment.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-guitar-and-bed-view.jpg" title="Guitar with a travel pillow on top, old backpack (now replaced)." ></p>

<h2>Sleeping in a Prius</h2>

<h3>Night one</h3>

<p>First night in a Prius left me with mixed feelings. I parked in one of the
corporate areas of the city at about 9 pm. I picked a well lit parking lot with
some (but not much) evening traffic. I parked in one of the slightly darker
areas of the parking lot (approximately one out of twenty parking spots was
taken, and large number of cars made me feel safer).</p>

<p>It was 74F outside, slowly cooling after a 100F day. I left my car in accessory
mode (spoiler: bad idea), turned on the AC, locked the doors, and hopped on my
bedding arrangement to the back of the car. I didn&rsquo;t want to keep the windows
open since I just got them tinted. And sleeping with windows rolled down felt a
bit eerie.</p>

<p>First thing I noticed was how obnoxiously bright instrument panel and GPS are.
It was the opposite of stealthy, and it was plain annoying to sleep with those
bright lights on. I reached out for my duffle bag, and pulled out a couple of
towels to cover up both the instrument panel and GPS, as well as few AC control
LEDs. This made me feel at ease, and I tried to doze off into sleep.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-towels-on-instrument-panel.jpg" title="Towels covering an instrument panel and a GPS." ></p>

<p>The parking lot lights were a minor annoyance, mostly filtered out by a 20% rear
window tint. I&rsquo;ve heard some people pass somewhere within 20 feet of my car a
few times, but other than that it was quiet. Still, unfamiliar situation made it
hard to fall asleep.</p>

<p>And then a few voices and an engine noise disturbed my peace, pretty close to my
car. I waited for about 10 minutes, and the noise didn&rsquo;t go away. I raised my
head to see what&rsquo;s happening - turns out someone had a tire blowout a 2 parking
spots away from me, and a pickup truck pulled in next to them to help with
changing the tire. There were anywhere between 3 and 5 people walking around and
talking.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when I quickly got dressed, climbed to a driver&rsquo;s seat, and drove off to
look for a quieter spot. It was 9:55 pm.</p>

<p>I went to a more secluded, but still well lit parking lot behind one of the
offices. Concentration of cars was about the same, but it looked like those cars
were left there overnight. I picked a spot within 50 feet of other parked cars,
where a tree was covering my car from the harsh street light.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-parking-spot-by-the-tree.jpg" title="Parking spot by the tree." ></p>

<p>Accessory mode, AC, lock the doors. Climbed in the back, and after some
restlessness (a fairly normal thing for me), I fell asleep. I woke up sometime
around 11:30 pm. It was fairly hot in the car, and it was hard to breathe. Turns
out accessory mode turned itself off at some point. Maybe the battery ran low,
or maybe there&rsquo;s a time limit of sort. I opened all the doors to air out a car
for a couple of minutes while I walked around and stretched.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I also noticed that because of the tinted windows, it&rsquo;s nearly
impossible to see what&rsquo;s inside the car while only standing a few feet away
from it. That was comforting.</p>

<p>Second attempt, this time I turned on the car the usual way (by depressing the
pedal). I used a foot brake for a peace of mind, set the AC to 68 degrees (with
external air flow setting), locked the car, covered the instrument panel and a
GPS, and climbed in the back.</p>

<p>AC was blowing on my neck, but I was too tired to worry about it. The car cooled
down and I climbed inside a sleeping bag (it was too hot before, and I was just
lying on top of it). I&rsquo;m used to sleeping on hard surfaces, so the setup felt
comfortable enough. The light from surrounding light poles was a bit too harsh,
so I covered my eyes with a T-shirt. I fell asleep.</p>

<p>I woke up a few times throughout the night, but I feel like I&rsquo;ve had enough
sleep. I woke up with the sun at about 6:30 am, got dressed, opened all doors to
ventilate the car, packed away a sleeping bag, and drove to work. I felt well
rested, even though my throat and neck felt a bit sore from the AC directed at
me.</p>

<p>Oh, and it cost me $1.40 to have an AC running through the night. The car would
turn on for about a minute every once in a while (30 minutes?) to recharge the
battery.</p>

<h3>Night two</h3>

<p>This time, I found a perfect spot in a small parking lot behind an office. Less
crowded than the previous time, but still well lit. I got lucky and found a
space with no direct street light being visible when laying down.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-parked-in-a-small-lot.jpg" title="Prius parked in a small parking lot." ></p>

<p>Turn the car on, AC to 68 degrees, lock the doors, hop to the back seat.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve slept well for the first couple of hours, but I ended up waking up well
rested at midnight. I stopped by my office and worked for a couple of hours.
Back to the car to get 4 more hours of sleep.</p>

<p>It cost me $1.38 to camp through the night with AC on.</p>

<h3>Night three</h3>

<p>My sleeping bag was too hot to use at room temperature, so I swapped it with a
summer down filled bag. I also purchased a self-inflating sleeping pad for more
comfort.</p>

<p>Things are getting better from now on.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-on-top-of-a-parking-garage.jpg" title="Prius on top of a parking garage." ></p>

<p>Feeling more confident, I found a four-story corporate parking lot and drove to
the top level. I parked at a well-lit spot without any direct lights coming
through the windows. I easily fell asleep a tad bit past nine, and woke up at 6
am refreshed and well rested. Secluded spot, comfortable sleeping pad, summer
sleeping bag, and increased confidence - all contributed to making sleeping in a
Prius a delightful experience.</p>

<p>This was also the night I learned a neat trick: if you recline the driver&rsquo;s seat
all the way, it becomes really easy to move between front seat and a sleeping
area.</p>

<p>Cost of running the car through the night: $1.63.</p>

<h3>Night four</h3>

<p>I decided to camp out in the same multi-level parking garage I did yesterday (it
has high enough number of cars so that I don&rsquo;t stand out - about one per fifty
parking spots; and the foot traffic is very low to non-existent). I found
another part of the garage with a roof access on a second level and pulled in
there. After getting situated, I realized I didn&rsquo;t account for all the lights -
bright parking lot lights from other levels ended up shining right in my face.
And even though I knew I couldn&rsquo;t be seen behind the tinted windows, it did
leave me feeling exposed.</p>

<p>I slid to the driver&rsquo;s seat and drove up a few levels to the previous spot.
Doors are locked, AC is set to 68F, instrument panel is covered, driver&rsquo;s seat
is reclined. I climbed to the back, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>It was a warm night, temperature outside was at 73F. It was hot enough for me to
wake up two times through the night, but that was a minor inconvenience.</p>

<p>Cost: $1.73.</p>

<h3>Night five</h3>

<p>It was one of the chillier nights, so sleeping was a very pleasant experience. I
picked the same spot I used on the third night. Absence of direct lights visible
from the car windows plays a huge role in making you feel safe.</p>

<p>Cost: $1.53 while also bringing Nexus 6 to a full charge.</p>

<h3>Night six</h3>

<p>Picked another spot in a similar area, I parked under a broken street light in a
well lit parking lot. I&rsquo;ve slept well. Mostly due to this being a cooler night
(65F).</p>

<p>Cost: $1.29 while also bringing Nexus 6 to a full charge.</p>

<h3>Night seven</h3>

<p>I was stuck in traffic in the evening, and I fiddled with the GPS for a while.
Turns out you can disable the obnoxiously bright screen by going into &ldquo;Setup&rdquo;
-> &ldquo;Display&rdquo; -> &ldquo;Screen off&rdquo;. Pushing any button on the GPS turns the screen
back on. I&rsquo;m still using the towels to cover up the instrument panel and AC
controls though.</p>

<p>Another fairly cold night, which made sleeping more comfortable. I went back to
the top of the parking garage. Night was a delight.</p>

<p>Cost: $1.39, with full Nexus 6 charging.</p>

<h3>Impressions</h3>

<p>Stealthy living in a Prius is very comfortable. With tinted windows there&rsquo;s just
enough privacy, it&rsquo;s safe and cheap to run AC through the night (cost averages
to about $1.48 per night). There&rsquo;s more than enough space for someone of my
height (5&#8217;11&#8221;). It took me a couple of days to get used to feeling relatively
exposed in public, but once I did - it was a breeze. Last five nights I have
slept without any problems.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, I&rsquo;ve slept better in a Prius than I did in my own bed. Here I
should probably note that I&rsquo;ve been having troubles sleeping on an off for some
time lately, and sleeping through the night in a car was a step up from where I
was before.</p>

<h3>Lessons learned</h3>

<p>Some things I didn&rsquo;t know before trying out sleeping in a Prius:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pick a well lit parking lot, ideally with some cars of similar value parked
overnight. Make sure there&rsquo;s not too much foot traffic.</li>
<li>Park in an area without direct light source near you. Also account for lights
visible from inside the car (light nearly a hundred feet away can still be
bother).</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re using the AC, turn Prius engine on instead of leaving it in
accessory mode.</li>
<li>Proper AC vent direction is important. Fiddle with those until there are no
drafts in the sleeping area.</li>
<li>Use a sleeping mask to avoid being bothered by the lights if you couldn&rsquo;t find
area without visible light sources shining directly through the windows.</li>
<li>Since the temperature inside the car is regulated, summer sleeping bag is a
must.</li>
<li>Sleeping pad is very helpful in making the surface softer. 1.5 inches made a
huge difference in comfort.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Items I used</h2>

<h2>Future improvement ideas</h2>

<p>I have a great stealthy setup, but having more privacy would&rsquo;ve been a nice
bonus. I&rsquo;ll probably look for some inconspicuous looking shades or curtains,
provided that the setup doesn&rsquo;t look too obvious.</p>

<h2>Philosophical implications</h2>

<p>This was an interesting experience. Inability to retreat to the safety of my
house got me out of my comfort zone. Initial discomfort passed quickly, and a
world of possibilities opened up to me.</p>

<p>Not having access to a house made me, well, feel bored. And that&rsquo;s amazing.
Without having an ability to default to a TV, gaming platform, or even a laptop
(it&rsquo;s really not that comfortable to work on a laptop in a car) - I had to get
creative. I got to play a guitar, a piano, sing, practice with a drum set. I
worked on my blog (this article took multiple revisions and hours upon hours of
time to look the way it does now). I went to Mozzart&rsquo;s Don Giovanni publicly
hosted in a nearby town.</p>

<p>And I finished this article, which took me about 8 days of revisions and
additions to finish.</p>

<p>Now, thanks to self-imposed restrictions, I&rsquo;m doing all the things I wanted to
do.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a perpetual planner. And that sometimes becomes a problem, since I&rsquo;m always
looking forward to the next thing that&rsquo;s going to happen, sometimes not paying
attention to life right in front of me. With everything I have packed in a car,
there&rsquo;s nothing on the horizon. Nothing is far away. There&rsquo;s no home to go back
to, so I don&rsquo;t rush anywhere. I savor every moment I have.</p>
