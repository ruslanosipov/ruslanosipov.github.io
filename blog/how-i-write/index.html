        How I write
        
    </h1>
    
  </header>


<div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I don&rsquo;t blog consistently, and I&rsquo;m still struggling to find my voice. I find writing difficult for many reasons, especially when it comes to identifying topics worth writing about. I want to bring a combination of passion, expertise, and a fresh perspective into a topic &ndash; which makes finding a theme to cover challenging. To top it all off, English is my third language. Getting the content to flow well is difficult, and I don&rsquo;t always have the ear for it.</p>

<p>In contrast, I find it straightforward to write once I know what to write about. In part due to the volume of writing I have to do for work: as a technical lead at Google I routinely use extensive design documents to communicate my ideas. I also <a href="https://amzn.to/3fRV1OV">wrote a book</a> once.</p>

<p>I found a set of techniques that work well for me. I don&rsquo;t know if these techniques help me write higher quality material &ndash; you&rsquo;ll be the judge of that. But these techniques help me express ideas from my head and onto paper. Hopefully in a digestible and entertaining format.</p>

<hr />

<p>I never took journalism 101. Like with many things in live, I found my own way of doing things: why take an easy path, when a difficult one could work just as well?</p>

<p>I break down writing process into a set of distinct steps. I start with some preliminary research, write an outline, do my in-depth research, write a wine draft, turn that into a coffee draft, and finally proofread the result. I try to take breaks and get some distance from whatever I&rsquo;m working on in between these steps.</p>

<h2>Preliminary research</h2>

<p>This is a step zero, although it might not apply to everything I write about. This is a breadth-first, &ldquo;open as many tabs as computer can handle&rdquo; type of research. There&rsquo;s no in-depth reading at this point, and only high level information is consumed.</p>

<p>I picked up this approach from my wife, who is an indisputable queen of online research. I find it tempting to dig into the first source I find. Stopping myself from digging too deep helps me understand the information landscape.</p>

<p>For instance, when writing about <a href="https://www.rosipov.com/blog/fire-in-a-developing-economy/">financial independence in Cote d&#8217;Ivoire</a> (a topic I know nothing about) my preliminary research consisted of: a brief review of country&rsquo;s history, a list of major geopolitical events, investment landscape, and identifying trustworthy sources which could tell me more about currency stability or tax situation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also looked for existing sources on the subject, but there wasn&rsquo;t any.</p>

<h2>Outline</h2>

<p>This post started with an outline. An outline is crucial to pacing and identifying areas of focus. Chapter summaries in a book, outlining headings in technical documents, or putting together a bulleted list for a blog post &ndash; you name it.</p>

<p>Outline only needs to make sense to you, and you don&rsquo;t have to use complete sentences. I started with the following outline for this post:</p>

<ul>
<li>I write a lot

<ul>
<li>Quantity doesn&rsquo;t mean quality</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t publish most things I write</li>
<li>A lot of practice with technical docs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Outline</li>
<li>Wine draft</li>
<li>Coffee draft</li>
</ul>


<p>An outline is not final, and it evolves as I write. For instance, by the time I wrote the bulk of this post, an outline evolved &ndash; something was removed, and a whole lot of things were added:</p>

<ul>
<li>I write a lot

<ul>
<li>Double down on how bad I am at writing

<ul>
<li>Quantity doesn&rsquo;t mean quality</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><del>I don&rsquo;t publish most things I write</del></li>
<li>A lot of practice with technical docs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Preliminary research</li>
<li>Write an outline (you&rsquo;re here now!)</li>
<li>In-depth research</li>
<li>Write wine draft</li>
<li>Write coffee draft</li>
<li>Proofread the result</li>
</ul>


<p>I like to keep an outline on the screen as I write, as it reminds me to write in context. I often jot down a brief outline when I have ideas about writing something: this way I don&rsquo;t have to start from scratch when I sit down to write.</p>

<h2>In-depth research</h2>

<p>This is where I actually read through dozens of tabs I opened during the preliminary research. This is where I spend the most of my time for topics I don&rsquo;t feel particularly comfortable with.</p>

<p>I make a point to time box research tasks. It&rsquo;s easy to go down a rabbit hole when researching a topic, and there&rsquo;s always more to learn the more you understand the subject. Putting a time limit on each research topic helps me stay on track.</p>

<h2>Wine draft</h2>

<p>Step 4 out of 6: this is when I start writing.</p>

<p>I found it near impossible to write without separating creative stream of conciousness from the editing process. The &ldquo;wine draft&rdquo; is the first attempt at filling in the blanks. The grammar can be all wrong, and the sentences don&rsquo;t always have to make sense. It&rsquo;s not necessary for the content to flow or read nicely.</p>

<p>This is where the outline really helps, because writing top to bottom is generally very difficult. Filling in the blanks under the outline however is much easier. I often find myself jumping between different headings and writing a little bit here and there under each heading.</p>

<p>Prioritizing cadence during this step helps, as a stable writing rhythm helps me enter the state of flow. To stay in the flow, I have a wine draft authoring rule: no sentence-level editing. Moving paragraphs or headings around is fine, but changing sentences is generally not.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the goal - get as much content out as possible, no matter how much the language rules get abused. I find it easier to edit down a boatload of content, rather than struggle to come up with the missing pieces when editing.</p>

<p>This is the stage when I decide if the content is not worth publishing &ndash; many of my wine drafts never see the light of day.</p>

<p>I find accompanying wine mandatory, but whiskey or tea works in a pinch.</p>

<h2>Coffee draft</h2>

<p>After the wine draft is complete, I take a break. Often couple of hours is enough to create a distance between me and the text. A coffee draft requires more focus and attention. This is when the messy draft takes shape and becomes (hopefully) readable. You tell me.</p>

<p>I make my way down, sentence by sentence, turning ramblings of a madman into a coherent narrative. I rearrange sentences, correct syntactic and grammatical errors, and liberally remove what doesn&rsquo;t contribute to the narrative. If the wine draft is particularly incoherent, I simply rewrite each paragraph one by one.</p>

<p>This is when I add illustrations if need be. A coffee draft is nearly the final result, barring typos and minor mistakes.</p>

<p>Coffee helps here, but, unlike with a wine draft, is not required.</p>

<h2>Proofreading</h2>

<p>The final step involves good old proofreading (unless you have a proofreader: it was great having one when working with a publisher).</p>

<p>I try to proofread in a different software suite, or with different fonts and colors: it helps create further distance between the content and I. For instance, I write this post in Vim using Markdown, but I proofread by reading the final preview using my blog&rsquo;s visual theme.</p>

<p>It often helps to read things out loud too: anything you can do to change up the way you perceive the text.</p>

<hr />

<p>And finally it&rsquo;s ready to be published: ta-da! This method hasn&rsquo;t failed me yet, be it for writing <a href="https://amzn.to/3fRV1OV">Mastering Vim</a>, technical design docs at Google, or blog posts like this one. Fingers crossed it&rsquo;ll continue working well for me.</p>
