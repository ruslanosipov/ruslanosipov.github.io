  <div class="entry-content"><p>I generally don&rsquo;t use Mutt for everyday emails - I find smooth non-monospace
fonts to be more pleasant to the eye, and the visualization my browser offers
is hard to beat. The main use-case for me is composing long emails: Mutt lets
me use my favorite text editor, which speeds up the editing of long and
carefully composed responses.</p>

<p>Recently I added a new use-case to my work flow: searching through emails.
Mutt has a powerful built-in regular-expressions engine, which is something the
web Gmail client is missing.</p>

<p>Mutt has two ways of finding things: search and limit. &ldquo;Search&rdquo; just jumps from
one matching letter to another, something along the lines what <code>/</code> command does
in <code>less</code>, <code>more</code>, or <code>vim</code>. &ldquo;Limit&rdquo; is something I am more used to with the
web client, and it&rsquo;s what I use the most.</p>

<h2>Using limits</h2>

<p>Limit works the way regular search works in Gmail: it limits the view to
conversations matching the query. Hit <code>l</code>, and enter a search query.</p>

<p>By default, Mutt will only search through the subject lines, but this behaviour
can be changed by prefixing the command with a special identifier. For
instance, searching for <code>~b oranges</code> will limit the view to all the messages
which mention &ldquo;oranges&rdquo; in the message body. Here are a couple I use the most:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>~b</code> &ndash; Search in the message body.</li>
<li><code>~B</code> &ndash; Search in the whole message.</li>
<li><code>~f</code> &ndash; Message originated from the user.</li>
<li><code>~Q</code> &ndash; Messages which have been replied to.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can find full list in the <a href="http://www.mutt.org/doc/manual/manual-4.html#ss4.2">Mutt Advanced Usage Manual</a>.</p>

<p>Patterns can be chained to produce narrower results: <code>~f joe ~B apples</code>. This
will search for a message mentioning &ldquo;apples&rdquo; coming from an author whose name
contains &ldquo;joe&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Caching mail for faster search</h3>

<p>You may find that searching whole messages is slow, especially if you have more
than a couple hundred messages to search through. That&rsquo;s because by default
Mutt does not store messages for local use. This can be changed by specifying
<code>header_cache</code> and <code>message_cachedir</code> variables in your <code>.muttrc</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>set header_cache     = "$HOME/Mail"
set message_cachedir = "$HOME/Mail"
</code></pre>

<p>Now, after you perform your first search, it will cache every message you open,
making all the consecutive searches lightning fast.</p>

<p>Oh, and keep in mind, Mutt stores messages and headers in plain text, so make
sure the cache directory is not shared with anyone but yourself.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Limiting code to 80 (or 100 or 120) characters per line. It&rsquo;s a well-known
topic, and there&rsquo;s an overall consensus on the subject, not counting occasional
questions by newbies and odd cases. Most established tech companies have their
own line length guidelines. These are often dependent on a language, such as in
the case of Google with their 80 character Python and 100 character Java limits.</p>

<p>In this article, I won&rsquo;t be advocating all the usual arguments, such as easier
diff with version control software, or the ability to stack windows side by side
on wide screens. No, I believe that battle to be won quite a long time ago, the
topic is now closed. But something I didn&rsquo;t find mentioned in any of the
discussions is an interesting point from the world of writers and designers.</p>

<p>Ever since I started being interested in improving my writing skills, I found
article after article mention the importance of line length in reading.
Interestingly enough, this issue was raised in a world of literature. It had
been resolved long before programmers were fascinated with the desire to use up
rapidly expanding screen real estate.</p>

<p>I am talking about something known as &ldquo;measure&rdquo; in typography. It seems to be
the reason newspapers use narrow columns, or books leave such vast margins
around the text on a page. Here&rsquo;s an exempt from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(typography)">Wikipedia article</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Measure (or sometimes &ldquo;The Measure&rdquo;) in typography is the length of a line of
text. For a single-column design measure should ideally lie between 40 &amp; 80
characters. Many typographers consider the perfect measure to be 65
characters. If the lines are too short then the text becomes disjointed, if
they are too long the content loses rhythm as the reader searches for the
start of each line. Punctuation should preferably hang outside the measure.</p></blockquote>

<p>Most programming languages use special operators and keywords, which can be
considered &ldquo;punctuation&rdquo;. Some languages are more verbose (use more
punctuation), and some aren&rsquo;t. If you remove punctuation, the 80/100/120
character limit perfectly fits the standard time-honed &ldquo;measure&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Maybe I can use this as an additional argument the next time I have to explain
to a junior new hire why the character limits are so strictly enforced.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spend most of my development time in the shell - be it editing text with Vim
or executing various console commands. I have quite a number of tricks in my
daily repertoire, and I would like to share three tips today.</p>

<h2>Edit current command with a text editor</h2>

<p>I often end up having to change a long command I just typed, and using arrow
keys to get to the correct spot is not favorable. Bash has the feature which
lets you edit current command in a text editor of your choice. Hit <code>Ctrl + x</code>,
<code>Ctrl + e</code> (or <code>Ctrl + x + e</code>), and you will be dropped into your text editor.
Now you are able to edit the command, and it will be executed as soon as your
write the file and exit the editor.</p>

<p>You can use an editor of your choice by adding following line to your <code>.bashrc</code>
file:</p>

<pre><code>export EDITOR=vim
</code></pre>

<p>Replace <code>vim</code> with the name of your favorite editor.</p>

<p>Update: It looks like for some machines setting <code>EDITOR</code> variable is not
enough. In this case, you also need to set <code>VISUAL</code> environment variable.</p>

<h2>Edit recent command</h2>

<p>You can edit your recent commands in a text editor of your choice by executing
<code>fc beginning_of_the_command</code>. For instance, if you run <code>fc l</code>, you will open
most recent command starting with the letter &ldquo;l&rdquo;.</p>

<p>You can execute <code>fc</code> without any arguments to edit last executed command.</p>

<h2>Bash history autocomplete</h2>

<p>Another great feature - &ldquo;reverse intelligent search&rdquo;. If you hit <code>Ctrl + r</code> in
your shell, you&rsquo;ll be greeted by the following prompt:</p>

<pre><code>(reverse-i-search)`':
</code></pre>

<p>Start typing a part of the command from your history, and you&rsquo;ll see suggestions
popping up. Hit <code>Enter</code> to pick the command (you&rsquo;ll be able to edit it before
executing), or push <code>Ctrl + g</code> to return back.</p>

<p>Like any of these tips? Have some of your own? Don&rsquo;t hesitate to share those in
the comments section down below.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I&rsquo;ve been writing much more than I used to: long emails, software
documentation, personal Wiki, keeping work journal, blogging, writing
challenges&hellip; Luckily enough, I do all of this writing in Vim. But sometimes
writing prose in Vim might feel a bit unnatural, especially if you have a wide
screen: text will be on the very left side of the screen, or (if <code>textwrap</code> is
not enabled) you&rsquo;ll end up with lines hundreds of characters long. And overall,
editing text in Vim sometimes might feel a bit clunky - with all the extra
information and high-tech (or low-tech, depending on your perspective) look.</p>

<p>I found a simple, yet sufficient solution for this issue: <a href="http://projects.mikewest.org/vimroom/">VimRoom</a>. It&rsquo;s a
Vim plugin which enters distraction-free writing mode, by centering the
80-character block of text on your screen. It&rsquo;s highly configurable, and I
found it to look especially pleasing on vertical monitors (which I prefer to
use for writing). It looks presentable even on smaller screens though, here&rsquo;s a
screenshot:</p>

<p><img src="/images/vimroom-screenshot.png" title="VimRoom plugin in use." ></p>

<p>Install the plugin (use a package manager like Vundle or <a href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/vim-pathogen-and-git-submodules/">Pathogen</a> to
simplify the task) and add a following line to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>nnoremap &lt;Leader&gt;vr :VimroomToggle&lt;CR&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, hit <code>&lt;Leader&gt;vr</code> to drop in/out of the VimRoom mode (<code>&lt;Leader</code> is a
backslash <code>\</code> character by default).</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally did it! I&rsquo;ve left the dark corners of WordPress in favor of
<a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, which seem to be the best system for my blogging needs.</p>

<h2>Why the migration?</h2>

<p>WordPress was a great host for me at one point - the community is fun and no
work is required for setup (I would rather not waste time fiddling with my blog
too much). But a number of things are off-putting:</p>

<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t like WYSIWYG editors and I don&rsquo;t like web editors. I try to use my
favorite editor for everything, including mail, documentation, note taking.
Even though WordPress allowed me to write my posts using Markdown, I still
didn&rsquo;t like not being able to use my favorite editor or environment.</li>
<li>Storing all the entries in a MySQL database is not favorable. I am writing
text, why would I pick any other format to store what I wrote?</li>
<li>Over the years my blog became increasingly slow, and in order to have a
reasonably fast site I needed to pay quite a sum of money. I am not ready for
such a commitment, since I only occasionally update this blog.</li>
</ul>


<p>On the other hand, Octopress (which is based on Jekyll, a static site
generator) has all of these concerns covered:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can write by creating simple Markdown documents. It doesn&rsquo;t matter where I
write, or how I write. This enables me to use an editor of my choice.</li>
<li>Plain text is universal. It can be viewed by a human, edited in any piece of
software, printed out, emailed, piped to a Linux program - just about
anything really.</li>
<li>Static sites are ridiculously fast. There&rsquo;s no preprocessing and no
rendering.  The only real speed limit is network latency. In addition, GitHub
lets you host static sites for free. What else could you ask for?</li>
</ul>


<h2>The process is painless</h2>

<p>Switching from WordPress to Octopress was very easy, and it took me only a few
hours (spread out throughout one weekend). Some highlights:</p>

<ol>
<li>Comments in Octopress are handled by <a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a>, and I had to set that up
on my WordPress blog before transitioning in order to transfer all the
comments.</li>
<li>I used the <a href="https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter">WordPress to Jekyll Exporter</a> tool to export all my posts
from WordPress to Markdown (with meta-data which Octopress understands). I only
had a bit over 50 posts to worry about, so the process was complete in an
instant.</li>
<li>I ran some custom Vim macros to remove and change some excess meta data, as
well as clean up Markdown formatting. I am a perfectionist, and the exporter
tool left me with a poorly formatted document. I couldn&rsquo;t let that happen.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Results are breathtaking</h2>

<p>After only a few hours of work, I had a lightning fast, simple, and pragmatic
blog. There is no excess configuration, comments are handled externally, and
the source code for the site and articles is available on GitHub. I am able to
write my posts using Markdown, in my favorite editor, and use git to publish
the resulting articles.</p>
