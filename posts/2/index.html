  <div class="entry-content"><p>I use email a lot. Maybe not as much as some, but I receive and send a fair
share of mail each day. You might find it odd, but I love using email. It&rsquo;s a
pleasant and calm experience, and sorting through a pile of messages every
morning rewards me with a sense of achievement. There are, however, few tricks
I have up my sleeve, and I would like to share them today. These tips will not
necessarily make you more productive, but they will provide you a with a more
pleasant and peaceful experience of managing your inbox.</p>

<p>But first, I would like to set the scene&hellip;</p>

<h2>The wonderful Mailbox app</h2>

<p>I started using iOS email client called <a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com">Mailbox</a> a little over a year ago,
shortly after a release. Back then, before it was acquired by Dropbox, you had
to wait in order for the company to grow their servers. I patiently waited &ldquo;in
line&rdquo; for almost a month and I finally was able to transfer all my accounts to
this wonderful mail client.</p>

<p>It was worth waiting for. Right after starting, Mailbox archived all the
conversations in my inbox, and presented me with a list of unread emails which
looked an awful lot like a To-Do list. You can read and reply, archive the
important letters, delete junk, or resend a conversation to yourself after a
certain time span as a reminder. This is an extremely simple idea, but it is
essentially what anyone&rsquo;s inbox is: a list of things which need to be done.
Some emails have to be replied to, some have to be acted upon in some other
way. The ones that don&rsquo;t get archived are deleted right away.</p>

<p>Mailbox turned my trash-filled inbox into a clean list of items I need to do.
Since then, there never was an email I forgot to reply to, nor an important
thing I forgot to do. Inbox can be referred to as &ldquo;To Do&rdquo;, and an archive as
&ldquo;Done&rdquo;. This scheme makes it nearly impossible to miss anything of importance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Mailbox is an iOS-only application, and I started noticing the
shortcomings of the desktop experience. And I do use desktop mail far more
often than mobile. I decided to have a set of rules for managing my inbox; and
this is the workflow I have been successfully using for over a year.</p>

<h2>Workflow outside of the Mailbox app</h2>

<p><img src="/images/zero-mail-inbox-in-gmail.png" title="Having clean inbox is rewarding." ></p>

<p>I only use Gmail, and there probably are ways to have the same experience on
other platforms. However, the Mailbox app works only with Gmail.</p>

<p>The first thing which needs to be done in order to start using the zero mail
inbox workflow &ndash; is to empty it from all the read mail. Thankfully, the Mailbox
app archives all your previous conversations the moment you install it.</p>

<p>Next, there has to be a way to implement a &ldquo;snooze&rdquo; button. There are always
times when you can&rsquo;t reply to an email, but don&rsquo;t exactly want to keep it in
your inbox (what an eyesore). Gmail does not provide a native way to resend
your emails at later times, but I found a Chrome extension called
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snooze-your-email-for-gma/pbmfoncgccdhoknelpglaacbgkclcape">&ldquo;Snooze Your Email for Gmail&rdquo;</a>, which adds a simple &ldquo;Snooze&rdquo; button to the
Gmail UI.</p>

<p>Now that these two things are taken care of, there is a simple set of rules to
be used when a new email comes in:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Delete.</em> Is it a notification? Does it require saving for future
reference? A lot of things should be deleted. Bills, notifications,
messages from robots: these don&rsquo;t have to be saved. Items in Gmail trash
live for 30 days, which is enough time to find something in case of an
emergency. In addition, most of this information is available from some
another source anyway.</li>
<li><em>Snooze.</em> Do you have time right now to read/reply/act upon this email?
Remind yourself about it in a few hours or days instead.</li>
<li><em>Archive.</em> Conversation with a real person you might want to reference to
later? I save all the email chains from humans, just in case I have to
search through them at a later date.</li>
<li><em>Reply and archive.</em> Self-explanatory. Act upon and save for future
reference.</li>
<li><em>Let it be.</em> This is an eyesore version of using the &ldquo;Snooze&rdquo; button. You
usually want to do this only if there are more important emails to read and
act upon before getting to this one.</li>
</ul>


<p>Ideally, when you keep items in your inbox &ndash; this means they have to be acted
upon in some way. There is no reason not to archive or delete conversations
which don&rsquo;t require actions.</p>

<h2>Bonus point: labels</h2>

<p>This is a recent addition to my repertoire. I found myself often searching
through certain sets of email, and hence Gmail does not support regular
expressions it&rsquo;s quite a big pain in the neck for me when I can&rsquo;t remember
certain details. I created a set of thematic labels, which group emails by
projects, products, and teams. And I started religiously assigning them to all
the emails I archive. First it takes a bit of work, but after a while it
becomes easy to identify a pattern and create filters to assist yourself with
categorization.</p>

<p>As a result, I can  narrow down a search to a thematic subset of emails, saving
myself a lot of time and frustration.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It upsets me greatly, since there is no immediate or obvious solution to an
interviewing scheme which will fit every company. Some companies seem to find
processes which work for their size and culture, while others struggle to do
so. Human resources management is a complex subject, and it&rsquo;s hard to get
right.</p>

<p>I have experience with only a small subset of interviewing techniques, but none
of the following interview components I employ seem satisfactory.</p>

<h2>Screening</h2>

<p>Screenings are usually done by recruiters, employees whose skills are in
seeking and evaluating prospective assets to the company. The first problem
here is that <em>recruiters are not team members</em>. Recruiters might do a really
good job at, say, finding good recruiters &ndash; since this is their domain, and
something they are inherently good at. But they don&rsquo;t develop software.
Recruiters don&rsquo;t work with tech leads and team members, they don&rsquo;t have the
slightest real life idea what managers and leaders want from the potential
hire. Hell, the problem is &ndash; most team leads don&rsquo;t even know what kind of
person they need. And if they do, they don&rsquo;t have a slightest idea on how to
communicate this properly to the recruiters.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, software engineers and team leads would do recruiting
themselves. But this way they would not have time to do their own job, and
would thus become recruiters. Boom, the company lost a good software engineer.
So you end up hiring recruiters, who have not the slightest idea what a team
needs (&ldquo;person has to be proficient in Blah-blah-blah&rdquo; is like saying that a
writer has to be an expert at writing about red cubes).</p>

<p>Is there a solution? Probably, maybe, I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe recruiters and
software engineers have to communicate more. Set up meetings to discuss team
needs, go through training in regards to identifying key traits in prospective
engineers. Teams of engineers have to communicate their preferences better.
Engineers are hired to fit the culture, not to be a &ldquo;rock star&rdquo;. Geniuses don&rsquo;t
go through the HR process, future team members do.</p>

<h2>Interview with another engineer</h2>

<p>This, even though it has a good intent, is a big whopping failure. What this
originally is meant to do &ndash; is have a potential colleague evaluate the
candidate. Sounds like a fantastic idea in theory, and sometimes it even works
the way it is intended to.</p>

<p>Most of the time, however, you end up with a competition-driven technological
fanatic bombarding an interviewee with smart-ass obscure trick questions they
discovered that one time browsing their favorite language&rsquo;s mailing lists from
the year 1990. In the worst-case scenario, the candidate is not able to answer
any of those terrible questions, satisfying the interviewer&rsquo;s ego while she
cranks out a negative report to a recruiter.</p>

<p>In a slightly better version, an engineer will give a candidate a set of
hands-on tasks which rarely have anything to do with the real job
responsibilities. One version of this: pair programming segment, on the
engineer&rsquo;s machine, under stress and with shaking hands. Are we hiring
contestants for a hackathon?</p>

<p>When it comes to software engineering, everyone suddenly forgets that writing
code is the smallest portion of the day. This might not be the case for junior
programmers, but they are not the ones companies are wasting their hiring
resources on. It&rsquo;s the mid-level and senior workers who weren&rsquo;t even evaluated
on half of their job responsibilities. How are their human interaction skills?
Are they pleasant to work with? Will they have issues with company policies?
<em>Will they fit?</em> These questions are as important as one&rsquo;s ability to put
together a few lines of code.</p>

<p>Maybe interviewers have to spend less time checking how well candidates write
code under pressure, and more time evaluating if they will be a good match for
the company&rsquo;s culture. How do they react when you point out their mistake? Can
they communicate concepts clearly? Are they good at marketing themselves? You
hire people, not code generating machines. Unless that&rsquo;s what you need, of
course.</p>

<h2>Home assignments</h2>

<p>Home assignments are something I personally like and despise and the same time.
And I find it sad that there are a number of big fat minuses with this
approach. First, one might find it insulting. &ldquo;What, I have to write code for
you in my own time? Couldn&rsquo;t you evaluate me on an interview or something?&rdquo;
This method can turn a lot of people off, and unfortunately the ones that stay
are not typically the best quality.</p>

<p>As my co-worker wisely pointed out, if you have a choice between two overall
equal companies and one requires you to do more work before being considered &ndash;
you will naturally pick one that accepts you easier. Any job seeker would feel
more appreciated and trusted taking that route.</p>

<p>The honesty factor doesn&rsquo;t play much role here, since you usually can tell if
the person did not write everything herself during the one-on-one followup. But
the cost does play a role. The interviewer has to come up with a relatively
unique assignment, spend time reading and evaluating the written program, give
feedback on a follow-up interview. This adds up if you have many candidates.</p>

<p>This technique does make sense when the list of candidates needs to be narrowed
down, or when you&rsquo;re at the top of your domain. Who wouldn&rsquo;t complete a
day-long homework for Google? Many people will happily spend a sleepless night
for an employment opportunity. Even more wouldn&rsquo;t, especially if someone has a
number of options lined up in front of them.</p>

<h2>What about other methods?</h2>

<p>There is a large number of various interviewing techniques out there. Some
companies combine the above specified methods to have a bare-bone hiring
template. Some make candidates do paid work for a few weeks before being
accepted as a new hire. Some don&rsquo;t bother and just decide to wing it.</p>

<p>This is still a developing area; I am afraid the solution has to be obtained
through the method of trial and error. There seems to be no success recipe
which works for everyone. There are, however, a number of alternative
solutions. I don&rsquo;t think most companies put enough resources in finding a
successful technique, instead opting for whatever method is in season at the
moment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You might wonder what an English language style guide from 1918 is doing in a
software engineering blog. You might even get angry at me for pointing this
book in your face. But I have a strong affection towards this guide; I believe
everyone who has to write more than a sentence in English should read it. I
like to emphasize the communication aspects of a software engineering career as
much as coding or management skills.</p>

<p>English is not my native language, and I often struggle with the writing style.
I found a number of style tips online and in the books I read, but lately I
noticed a pattern: most of those tips referenced &ldquo;The Elements Of Style&rdquo;. The
book is available online free of charge (copyright has expired; it is now in
public domain) and takes only an evening to read.</p>

<p>What the book gives you is invaluable writing advice. The author provides
concrete style rules targeted at increasing the appeal and comprehension rates
of your text. Here&rsquo;s my favorite piece of advice:</p>

<blockquote><p>13. Omit needless words.</p>

<p>Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary
words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a
drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary
parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or
that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that
he make every word tell.</p></blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;The Elements Of Style&rdquo; is a timeless classic; it should be mandatory reading
for every speaker or learner of English out there. I immediately applied the
rules to technical documentation, email communication, and even this very blog
entry. I will probably have to read through the guide multiple times over the
course of the following months in order to ensure maximum retention. If you
care about being understood by another human being, you should read it too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been trying to read at least one book every week, and this
week&rsquo;s pick was &ldquo;Expert Python Programming&rdquo; by Tarek Ziade. Besides its few
shortcomings, I found it to be useful &ndash; Python is a language of choice for me,
and I found some valuable tips I could add to my arsenal.</p>

<p>The best thing about this book is that it covers a very wide range of topics:
syntax recommendations and code profiling, testing practices and project
management, technical writing and design patterns, package distribution and
version control&hellip; My favorite chapter covered writing technical documentation:
I am very interested in writing in general, and the tips Ziade provided turned
out to be very useful for documenting code, writing design documents, and even
posting to this blog. Not much else caught my eye, but I had a number of &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo;
moments such as, &ldquo;Oh, I never used that!&rdquo; and &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an interesting topic to
look into!&rdquo; scattered throughout the book. This book is very useful for filling
in little gaps in knowledge which programmers can have: the author covers an
extremely wide variety of Python development aspects.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I found the book to be poorly written. Weak writing style, typos
in the text and code examples &ndash; it looked like the book was put together
sloppily, in haste. Reviewers did not do a very good job evaluating this book.
&ldquo;Expert Python Programming&rdquo; gives you the feeling that the author tried to fit
in as much content (and code) as possible in his book, with no consistent
style. Many chapters go into unnecessary details, and the author has tendency
to paste completely useless chunks of code, such as a page-long output of an
installer. As I have mentioned, the book hops from one topic to another, and
covers a wide variety of subjects: this is both a key strength and the biggest
weakness of the book. There is just &ldquo;too much stuff&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s too scattered
across the topics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Expert Python Programming&rdquo; will be of best use to, you guessed it, an expert.
I found it best to scan through the content and seek out interesting bits of
information. Beginners, however, might be completely overwhelmed. While
advanced and intermediate Pythonistas will get the most out of this book, it
will probably be too hard (and painful) to read to be of real value.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I received in the mail a copy of Steve Krug&rsquo;s &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Make Me Think,
Revisited: A Common Sense Approach To Web And Mobile Usability&rdquo; (oh, that&rsquo;s a
long name). I went through the whole book only in under a few hours, and I am
so glad I&rsquo;ve read it. It&rsquo;s a very quick read, but the book is full of concrete
and valuable tips and advice about usability.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Make Me Think&rdquo; contains practical advice on a large number of topics:
web and mobile usability, design, and writing for the web. The advice can be
easily used and incorporated into your daily workflow; and the author provides
concrete guidelines for applying his tips in the real world.</p>

<p>The biggest thing I&rsquo;ve learned from this book (and want to apply in practice)
is individual usability testing. I actually performed my first usability test
just three days ago, just before reading &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Make Me Think&rdquo;, after I found
that Donald Norman&rsquo;s masterpiece mentioned observing user interactions with
your product (I&rsquo;ll get to the similarities between two of these books in a
moment).</p>

<p>I asked two of my colleagues, one after another, to visit a website I was
working on, and I silently watched them navigate through it. They had never
seen the website before, and the results were very shocking to me: they ignored
the things most obvious to me, but attempted to click through things which are
not even meant to be clicked. I carefully wrote down all of my findings, and
delivered the patches with enhancements to improve the biggest areas of
struggle these particular users had faced.</p>

<p>Usability testing turned out to be invaluable: it pointed out actions that I,
as a developer, did not anticipate, and highlighted parts of the system ignored
by the users. I now plan to run usability tests regularly, grabbing colleagues
from the hallway, and asking them to use my application for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Steve Krug&rsquo;s book is very much like <a href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/the-design-of-everyday-things/">&ldquo;The Design Of Everyday Things&rdquo;</a>, but
stripped from the extended theoretical part. The book references Norman&rsquo;s work
quite a lot, and seems to be heavily influenced by it. It focuses on practical
aspects of designing easy to use and understandable user interfaces. It
successfully explains why you should be thoughtful of user experience,
accessibility, and understanding the way users think. I would recommend reading
this book after reading Donald Norman&rsquo;s masterpiece first, since it provides
you with the reasoning behind many decisions Steve Krug makes throughout his
book.</p>
