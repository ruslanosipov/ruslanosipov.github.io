  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>My first remote work experience coincided with my self-employment as a contractor. I was building a copyright enforcement service for a client in a year 2013. I lived in a one bedroom apartment in Philadelphia with my now ex-wife &ndash; a few blocks away from the city hall. I worked at a small standing desk (trendy!) in a corner of our little bedroom - by the closet.</p>

<p>I worked from the early morning and deep into the night at that desk. Sometimes I would look out of the window behind me. I would see an uninspired urban picture of roof tops of other four story colonial homes. And after a moment of respite it was back to work for me.</p>

<p>This was my first major foray into the world of self-accountability: I meticulously tracked the time spent working, billed the client per hour, provided in-depth breakdowns. The more I worked, the more I could bill the client &ndash; I had the incentive to put in as much time into work as possible.</p>

<p>So I did. I clocked in 80 to 90 hours of billable time a week. The checks with a before unheard of hourly rate kept coming, so I kept putting in the hours. Neither I nor my significant other had major professional experience. (To be completely honest we didn&rsquo;t have much in the realm of like experience either). We kept on keeping on.</p>

<p>I thought about work during lunch. I was agonizing over the details when walking through the neighboring Rittenhouse Square. I would jump into late night coding sessions. As a young professional, I didn&rsquo;t see the need to draw lines between my work and my life &ndash; my life was my work. There was no &ldquo;me&rdquo; without work.</p>

<p>That is until I burnt out. I woke up one morning, and something inside me snapped. I realized that I couldn&rsquo;t spend another minute in front of the screen. I took a day off, and the feeling wouldn&rsquo;t pass. I felt numb and overwhelmed at the same time. A day filled with my favorite video games - and I still felt that way. A day at a museum - nothing. I didn&rsquo;t get better.</p>

<p>I invoked a force majeure clause in my contract. I transferred all the materials, sent the final invoice, and stepped away from the project.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t talk here about the ways to fight burnout, because I didn&rsquo;t know how to. I quit, took a break, and eventually moved onto another job. By the virtue of this happening early in my career, and me being rather young - I managed to &ldquo;snap out of it&rdquo; between jobs.</p>

<p>I wish I could share &ldquo;the one thing&rdquo; I did that helped - but there wasn&rsquo;t one. I don&rsquo;t remember how I took care of myself, and how I managed to get my head straight. All I remember that I felt discombobulated for weeks. And at some point the feeling went away. I couldn&rsquo;t work during that time.</p>

<p>Time passed. I moved across the country to the San Francisco Bay area for a job with Google. My now ex-wife and I split up &ndash; it was a civil, but nonetheless a difficult divorce.</p>

<p>Around that time, I spent a year traveling across the United States. I lived out of my car and stayed in hotels while working remotely on my own terms. I established strict working hours and routines.</p>

<p>I would start my work around 8 am, without paying mind to the timezone I&rsquo;d be in. I&rsquo;d work out of coffee shops, coworking spaces, or even campgrounds. I&rsquo;d always take a break for lunch. I&rsquo;d wrap up work at 4 pm, and not a minute longer. Constant travel and change of scenery encouraged me to keep to my work hours. I had to weigh in staying past my end of workday versus going out and sight seeing a new city. The wanderlust always won.</p>

<p>The work was out of my mind after 4 pm. That was easy to do with an adventure afoot, but years later and the habit stuck with me. I don&rsquo;t let thoughts about work slip into my day to day. My mind is my own outside of work.</p>

<p>That was a transformative experience, and it changed the way I see work. I know it&rsquo;s trendy to say this, but I don&rsquo;t live to work: I work to live.</p>

<p>Today, I work with some people who have never worked remotely before the pandemic. And I often hear a similar sounding sentiment: &ldquo;never again&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It makes me think about the time I was self-employed for the first time. Putting in 80 hour work weeks, and not having the awareness to understand how I was affecting myself and people around me. It created distance between me and my partner. I let the work spill into the time I had. In a way it made me less of an employee and less of person.</p>

<p>When the pandemic started I looked back to these memories. Google moved to continuous work from home model in March 2020. And I made a conscious effort not to slip into my early remote work days. I established a strict routine. Breakfast and lunch with my significant other (here&rsquo;s some closure to my divorce). No deviation from &ldquo;9 to 5&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I established an area for myself to work in &ndash; I bought a sturdy desk and a chair from a used office furniture reseller. I make an effort to create not only mental, but physical separation from work. I wear office clothes during the day, and change once I&rsquo;m done with work. I cook to distress after a long day. My partner and I adhere to scheduled date nights (we do leave room for spontaneity too).</p>

<p>That isn&rsquo;t to say I didn&rsquo;t slip over the past year: many times I stayed past an established time. I often started earlier than planned. And some days I would let work occupy my mind space as I&rsquo;m relaxing with my better half. We&rsquo;ve spent the past year working out of a one bedroom apartment. A bigger one than I worked out of 7 years ago, but still a one bedroom. It was difficult, and some days it still is.</p>

<p>But time and time again, I corrected the course and resumed my routine. During my soul searching adventure remote work was fun. Because this time working remotely is much harder. There are no sights to see. No new places to stay in. No novelty to look towards at the end of the day. Working from home in the middle of a pandemic is oh-so-difficult.</p>

<p>To be honest I can&rsquo;t wait to be back in the office. But I&rsquo;m also excited to work from home on my own terms. Because this isn&rsquo;t what remote work is like.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I write about Vim &ndash; a modal text editor &ndash; <a href="/blog/categories/vim">a lot</a>. In fact, in early 2018
I was approached by <a href="https://packtpub.com">Packt Publishing</a> &ndash; what I&rsquo;ve later learned to be a
&ldquo;quantity over quality&rdquo; publishing house. Over the next 6 to 9 months I wrote a
300-page <a href="https://amzn.to/3wBeTx4">&ldquo;Mastering Vim&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>It was a stressful endeavour, with a publisher rushing to meet internal
deadlines and eventually sending an unfinished draft to print. There were many
highlights too, like actually cranking out 300 pages of material, or getting to
work with Bram Moolenaar &ndash; the creator of Vim himself. Now that a few years
have passed and the book is at its 3rd edition, complete, and re-released &ndash;
I&rsquo;m a lot more happy with the result.</p>

<p>I can write a whole other essay about my experience working with the publisher,
but that&rsquo;s a horror story for another time.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t write to make money, but it&rsquo;s nice seeing a couple of hundred dollars
trickling in every quarter. Putting together spreadhseets is my favorite past
time, so here&rsquo;s a breakdown of my earnings from the time I wrote a book with
Packt.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/mastering-vim-amazon.png" title="A screenshot of &#34;Mastering Vim&#34; on Amazon.com." alt="A screenshot of &#34;Mastering Vim&#34; on Amazon.com."></p>

<p>As of April 2021, the English version of my book has 14 reviews on Amazon
averaging at 5 stars (that&rsquo;s more than I would hope for), which likely helps
keep the sales at a somewhat of a steady level.</p>

<p>I was signed into a default &ldquo;16% of net receipts&rdquo; contract, with a $2,000
advance given out to me. The advance was split into 5 milestone-based
installments: the first preliminary draft, 6 preliminary drafts, the remaining
preliminary drafts, the final drafts, and the publication. Although I didn&rsquo;t
urgently need the money, and the publisher may have just sent it as a bulk
$2,000 payment after the publication.</p>

<p>Eventually I received a PDF for the first quarter of my book being sold&hellip; And
here are the financials for Q4 2018:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Print # </th>
<th> Print $ </th>
<th> E-books # </th>
<th> E-books $ </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> 10      </td>
<td> $55.50  </td>
<td> 274       </td>
<td> $307.70   </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>A whopping 363 dollars and 20 cents in royalties! I didn&rsquo;t really think anyone
would be interested to read the book, so seeing 284 copies sold I was pretty
ecstatic!</p>

<p>Selling printed books seems to pay $5.55 per copy, while e-books only bring me
$1.12.</p>

<p>Now I didn&rsquo;t see any of that money, since I would have to &ldquo;pay back&rdquo; the
advance. I know it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;the advance&rdquo;, and I knew that I won&rsquo;t be getting
that first check in the mail &ndash; but it sucked a bit nonetheless.</p>

<p>After that I received some great news &ndash; my book was going to get
<a href="https://amzn.to/3fN7mFz">translated to Japanese</a>! During my last trip to Tokyo I made some friends
who were interested in Vim as much as I was, and one of them - Masafumi Okura -
decided to translate &ldquo;Mastering Vim&rdquo; into his native language. The legend found
close to three dozen mistakes in my book too, and is solely responsible for the
third edition of Mastering Vim!</p>

<p>Turns out the translation rights are expensive, and I&rsquo;m getting my cut as well
&ndash; $1,586.26! That&rsquo;s more than the first quarter of sales!</p>

<p>Packt advertised my book for a few months or so, but they seemed to have
quickly lost interest. I received my first 5 star review on Amazon though,
which was great! I spent the next month refreshing Amazon reviews daily, after
realizing that to be a path to acquiring a mental illness.</p>

<p>2019 came, and here are my next 4 quarterly statements:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Quarter      </th>
<th> Print # </th>
<th> Print $ </th>
<th> E-books # </th>
<th> E-books $ </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> 2019 Q1      </td>
<td> 29      </td>
<td> $141.89 </td>
<td> 202       </td>
<td> $337.49   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 2019 Q2      </td>
<td> 15      </td>
<td> $77.53  </td>
<td> 71        </td>

<tr>
<td> 2019 Q4      </td>
<td> 23      </td>
<td> $118.55 </td>
<td> 117       </td>
<td> $255.17   </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>I sold 86 print books and 447 e-books in 2019. You can see the higher numbers
correspond to seasonal sales. Notice the prices for Q3 and Q4. E-books sold in
Q3 pay me as much as $3.64 per copy, while in Q1 it&rsquo;s a meager $1.67 per book.
Print edition payout stays much more consistent.</p>

<p>Altogether, I earned $1432.66 from my first full year of selling &ldquo;Mastering
Vim&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Here are my 2020 earnings:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Quarter      </th>
<th> Print # </th>
<th> Print $ </th>
<th> E-books # </th>
<th> E-books $ </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> 2020 Q1      </td>
<td> 26      </td>
<td> $131.61 </td>
<td> 112       </td>
<td> $414.12   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 2020 Q2      </td>
<td> 22      </td>
<td> $106.67 </td>
<td> 77        </td>
<td> $379.61   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 2020 Q3      </td>
<td> 26      </td>
<td> $141.17 </td>
<td> 74        </td>
<td> $325.97   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 2020 Q4      </td>
<td> 45      </td>
<td> $236.69 </td>
<td> 166       </td>
<td> $458.07   </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>That&rsquo;s $1,533.38, a $100 more than in 2019. The patterns seem rather
predictable, with Q2 and Q3 being slow, and Q1 and Q4 displaying a noticeable
spike.</p>

<p>Finally, Packt offers service subscriptions &ndash; I believe the subscription is for
the courses they offer, but I can&rsquo;t say for sure. Payout per subscription is
small, and I&rsquo;ve earned $158.10 over the 9 quarters since publishing &ldquo;Mastering
Vim&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Across $3,329.24 in book sales, $1,586.26 in translation fees, and $158.10 in
subscriptions, this adds up to $5,073.60 over the 2+ years the book has been in
print. Looks like it can make for a decent supplemental income if you write
enough books, but I&rsquo;m saying that based on a sample size of one.</p>

<p>Throughout this time, my earnings per copy average at $5.16 for a print, and
$1.93 for an e-book (using weighted averages for quarterly sales).</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the last number in this post &ndash; this one purely for fun. Based on
the 16% royalty rate, Packt probably earned $31,710 from &ldquo;Mastering Vim&rdquo; so
far.</p>

      <h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/the-feedback-fallacy/" itemprop="url">The feedback fallacy</a></h2>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>After learning about <a href="https://amzn.to/3ukVvm5">&ldquo;Radical Candor&rdquo;</a>, I became obsessed with providing candid and compassionate feedback. I&rsquo;ve been especially focused on the ability to communicate areas of growth for individual on my team.</p>

<p>And then a colleague of mine shared <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/03/the-feedback-fallacy">&ldquo;The Feedback Fallacy&rdquo;</a> (published in the Harvard Business Review), which points to some research and outlines a few key problems why focusing on negative feedback might not be the best choice. Research shows that:</p>

<ul>
<li>people are bad at assessing other people</li>
<li>we learn best with positive reinforcement</li>
<li>focusing on shortcomings impairs learning</li>
<li>excellence is specific to an individual</li>
</ul>


<p>Like many pieces of business literature, it reads like an &ldquo;all-or-nothing&rdquo; approach (&ldquo;negative feedback - bad, positive feedback - good&rdquo;), and the most effective approach is likely somewhere in the middle. There&rsquo;s a place for positive and negative feedback, and it&rsquo;s the focus on positive reinforcement that I see as a primary takeaway from this article.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that my assessment of others&#8217; performance changes over time. It often depends on what self-help book I&rsquo;m reading at the moment if I&rsquo;m being entirely honest.</p>

<p>This piece made me think of the portrayal of successful people in media: there&rsquo;s an inherent cultural belief that successful people know what makes them successful, and all you need to do is to follow in their steps! What is often omitted is a mix of luck, some talent or hard work, topped with another serving of being in the right place at the right time. Warren Buffet can probably tell you what&rsquo;s the smartest thing to do with ten thousand dollars you have in your savings account. It&rsquo;s unlikely that his advice alone will get you to his <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=warren+buffett+net+worth">98.2 billion dollar net worth</a>.</p>

<p>It seems like once you get past basic competency, success identifiers seem unpredictable.</p>

<p>I attribute part of my professional success to having a reputation of a person who &ldquo;gets shit done&rdquo;. I naturally value qualities associated with that style of work. It&rsquo;s only natural that I prioritize on communication and organizational skills when assessing the performance of others.</p>

<p>In fact, the article made me think about how I landed with the reputation as a problem solver. Every time I accomplished a project on time, owned the problem space, involved the right parties, or raised alarms early &ndash; I received positive reinforcement. People I worked with valued those qualities, and years working with those people shaped what I perceive as an effective work style.</p>

<p>Yet, this work style is effective for me, and is not a solution for my peers.</p>

<p>Since reading <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/03/the-feedback-fallacy">&ldquo;The Feedback Fallacy&rdquo;</a>, I started focusing on the outcomes I like, as opposed to qualities I believe are valuable. Where before I would say &ldquo;Great comms on project X!&rdquo;, now I focus on specifics: &ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re up to on project X, which helps me communicate with stakeholder Y and plan resources for the project Z&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I&rsquo;m not an ill tempered person, and it takes quite a lot to get me riled up. In
the pandemic however getting frustrated has been oh so much easier!</p>

<p>For once, there are less face to face interactions, which makes me feel removed
from whomever I&rsquo;m talking to. The interactions that happen over video chat feel
a lot less personal, and despite regular deliberately scheduled 1:1 time it&rsquo;s
harder to connect with colleagues on a personal level.</p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s the lack of water cooler interactions between meetings. A colleague
of mine correctly pointed out that before the era of video chat meetings, we&rsquo;d
have the time to decompress and process content between meetings with those
micro-interactions. Having just a minute or two &ldquo;off the record&rdquo; after a large
call helps process, frame, and align prior interaction. And just sharing a laugh
or being able to say &ldquo;well that was stressful&rdquo; helps reduce the inevitable daily
stress buildup.</p>

<p>Finally, all of the above is true for everyone else - and we&rsquo;re already in a
melting pot of individuals with different communication styles. People are
getting frustrated, making other people even more frustrated. It&rsquo;s a frustration
chain reaction!</p>

<p>All of this led to me into a cycle of sending some snappy responses, feeling
terrible after time would pass, setting up time to profusely apologize face to
face, and wowing to never overreact to work stress sources again&hellip; Until the
next encounter that is. It all culminated with me getting entirely too
frustrated between 8:00 and 8:05 am last Thursday and taking a day just to
decompress.</p>

<p>And that reminded of something I&rsquo;ve learned years ago, and I something I would
practice with rigour - until the background frustration level rose that is.</p>

<p>Early in my career I&rsquo;ve been taught to cool down before sending that angry ping
or an email &ndash; type it up, leave it in my drafts - come back to it an hour or
two later.</p>

<p>In 9 out of 10 cases I end up deleting the message feeling relieved that an
incoherent stream of hatred never saw the light of day. Most of the time when
I&rsquo;m angry I don&rsquo;t really have a goal I&rsquo;m trying to accomplish (other than inform
all the parties involved of my feelings), and that&rsquo;s not a great basis for
professional communication.</p>

<p>In the remaining case, I would end up completely rewriting that email to remove
the hostile tone and focus on the source of the issue instead. There are
problems that are worth addressing with candor &ndash; but candor is too often
conflated for the lack of tact.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s hard to take a break at work - because there are often so many things
to do, and so little time to do them. Which makes taking a minute to breather
feel like a waste of time, when it&rsquo;s one of the most productive things you can
do in the long run.</p>

<p>So here I am, putting these thoughts into writing to remember to take a break
before initiating aggressive communications &ndash; hopefully the more I think about
this, the easier it gets to remember to pause, self-assess, and disconnect.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>A couple of months ago I had a conversation with a fellow employee &ndash; let&rsquo;s call
him Balgruuf &ndash; who decided to quit the grind and become a career coach.
Shortly after I&rsquo;ve witnessed them interact with our mutual acquaintance &ndash;
Farengar &ndash; who was in a difficult spot in their career. Balgruuf was
enthusiastically instructing on what are the exact steps Farengar must take, and
in what order. It generally felt like Balgruuf had this whole career thing
figured out, and Farengar just stumbled along. Needless to say, Farengar quickly
changed the topic.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t stopped thinking about mentorship since that day. In the 10 or so
years of my career so far, I&rsquo;ve had a number of mentors - both formal and
informal. I also get the opportunity to mentor people around me &ndash; both sides of
the relationship really fascinate me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had some mentors who worked really well for me - and some who didn&rsquo;t. I
also had more different level of success with mentoring people myself. And one
of the defining factors in a successful experience was this: people conflate
mentorship with giving advice &ndash; two different, but oh-so-close feeling things.
Let me elaborate on the difference with a tangentially related example.</p>

<p>Sometimes my wife comes home and shares frustrations that inevitably arise after
a long day at work. There&rsquo;s little to no room for my input, because she needs
somebody to just listen, or maybe a rubber duck to talk at. And sometimes my
better half wants to hear my thoughts on the subject. Needing to vent and asking
for advice are two completely distinct scenarios in this case.</p>

<p>Just like in my home life, sometimes people come looking for an advice. But more
often than not, they&rsquo;re looking for mentorship.</p>

<p>Giving advice is prescriptive, while mentorship is more nuanced, and takes more
finesse from both parties.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://amzn.to/2NYlWPb">Relationomics</a>, Randy Ross discusses a role that
relationships play in personal growth. He talks about the harmful &ldquo;self help&rdquo;
culture which discounts the value of human element in self-development.</p>

<p>This is the gap where mentorship fits in. There&rsquo;s one huge &ldquo;but&rdquo; though, and
that&rsquo;s the fact that the person needs to be ready for the specific feedback they
might be getting.</p>

<p>Mentor is there to guide the internal conversation, encourage insight, and
suggest a direction. Mentor is there to identify when someone who&rsquo;s being
mentored is heading in a completely wrong direction, or not addressing the
elephant in the room.</p>

<p>In fact, I&rsquo;ve been noticing a trend at Google to avoid trying to use the word
&ldquo;mentorship&rdquo; overall, to avoid the go-to advice slinging attitude of your
everyday Balgruuf. And it&rsquo;s been a helpful trend - since framing mentorship
relationship around guidance and reminding mentors to let those who are mentored
to drive the growth is crucial for healthy peer to peer learning.</p>

<p>Even if so-called mentor has some aspect of life completely figured out for
themselves, the person who&rsquo;s mentored must drive the whole journey. Otherwise
there&rsquo;s really no room for growth in that relationship.</p>
