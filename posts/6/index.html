      <h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/making-a-packing-spreadsheet/" itemprop="url">Making a packing spreadsheet</a></h2>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Being the unique person I am, I love traveling. Oftentimes I end up getting deep into trying to optimize my packing methods. There are dozens of tools online designed to help with this exact thing (services like <a href="http://lighterpack.com">Lighterpack</a> or <a href="http://geargrams.com">GearGrams</a>). But, being handy with code, I decided to dabble in the subject on my own.</p>

<p>One of the most important things in packing is the overall weight of the pack, and I always want to know what type of things are the heaviest. I also want to be able to run random queries on my data, whatever it is that I&rsquo;m trying to learn. I want to have an inventory of items (backpacks, clothes, storage solutions) which I can plug in and out of a spreadsheet to see how the resulting picture changes on the go. Working with software as my day job, I’d also like for the solution to be automated whenever possible.</p>

<p>Google Spreadsheets turned out to be the perfect solution, providing the ability to quickly sum up the weight of my things and output insights about the data.</p>

<h2>Final Result</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qDhMoVmmTroM-eN0MZIU2PzE5YucsyPhbuPZPDGhemM/edit#">link to the spreadsheet</a>, I encourage the reader to copy and play around with in anyway you see fit.</p>

<p>Here’s the final result for a multi-day trip I will have for this year. As you can see, my pack weighs around 3 kilograms or a bit over 6 freedom units (not including water). My recently purchased Nintendo Switch is the heaviest item (and it’s worth every gram as it makes flying tolerable), but clothes take up most of the weight:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/packing-spreadsheet.png" title="A screenshot of a packing spreadsheet." ></p>

<p>I use indentation levels to show that some items are contained within other items. This also lets me calculate the absolute and relative weights of a whole container with everything inside of it (see fields labeled “Container” and “Percentage”).</p>

<p>The “Weight” and the “Breakdown” fields indicate absolute and relative item weight respectively, which accounts for quantity of the item (quantity defaults to 1 if not explicitly set). Weight-related fields are color coded from lightest items in green to heaviest items in red.</p>

<p>Categories are used to group items and execute queries on the data and learn insights like these:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/packing-spreadsheet-weight-chart.png" title="A chart representing the weight of each category of items relative to a weight of the whole pack." ></p>

<p>There’s a separate sheet where I enter item names, categories, and weights, which I then use to automatically populate values above and autofill item names in the primary sheet:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/packing-spreadsheet-inventory.png" title="A screenshot of an inventory tab of the packing spreadsheet." ></p>

<h2>The Technical Details</h2>

<p>I haven’t worked with Google Spreadsheets (or Excel for that matter) a lot in the past, but with an access to clear documentation (and a hundred of web searches later) it was straightforward to get the hang of the it.</p>

<p>I started off by manually populating the final result sheet, manually adjusting formulas for Container/Percentage cells, as I had no idea how I would detect the indentation yet. I like when things look pretty, so I applied conditional formatting rules right away, and the looks of the sheet really haven’t changed throughout the process.</p>

<p>Next, I created an inventory sheet, which I wanted to use as a source of data in the resulting sheet. A few Google searches and some trial &amp; error resulted in a lookup formula:</p>

<pre><code>=ArrayFormula(
 IF(
   NOT(ISBLANK($B2)),
   INDEX(InventoryCategories, MATCH($B2, InventoryItems, 0)),
   IF(
     NOT(ISBLANK($C2)),
     INDEX(InventoryCategories, MATCH($C2, InventoryItems, 0)),
     INDEX(InventoryCategories, MATCH($D2, InventoryItems, 0))
   )
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p><code>ArrayFormula</code> is necessary in order to create arrays on the fly without printing intermediate results in the spreadsheet. <code>InventoryItems</code> and <code>InventoryCategories</code> are named ranges referring to item names and categories in the inventory sheet. <code>MATCH</code> finds an index of a first occurrence of the item name in the sheet, and retrieves corresponding category name. An item weight is retrieved by the exact same principle.</p>

<p>Trying to find the container weight took a lot more time, and resulted in a lot more headache. Solution for handling indentation in Google Spreadsheets wasn’t as elegant as I would have hoped for, but it got the job done:</p>

<pre><code>=ArrayFormula(
     SUM(
       $I2:INDIRECT(
         CONCATENATE(
           "$I",
           ROW() + IF(
             NOT(ISBLANK($B2)),
             MATCH(FALSE, ISBLANK($B3:$B), 0),
             MATCH(FALSE, ISBLANK($C3:$C), 0)
           ) - 1
         )
       )
     )
</code></pre>

<p>The formula above finds the first non-empty cell in a column. It starts searching from the next row (for example, for an item on a second row, we look at the third row and below). After it knows which row first non-empty cell is in, the formula turns it into a string (column $I contains item weights) and use it as an upper bound of a sum of the weights. Finished formula is a bit longer (it adds sugar to only display the number when needed), and if you’re interested - you can look it up in the spreadsheet.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/packing-spreadsheet-indentation.png" title="A screenshot used for explaining indentation logic." ></p>

<p>For example, in the screenshot above, the formula will start looking at cells in a column right after the &ldquo;Packing cube&rdquo;. As soon as it finds a non-empty cell (&ldquo;Nintendo Switch case&rdquo;), the formula will determine this row to be an upper boundary. The formula then will sum weights starting with a &ldquo;Packing cube&rdquo; row, and up to but not including &ldquo;Nintendo Switch case&rdquo; row.</p>

<p>The rest involved many small tweaks, adding pretty colors, hiding N/A errors and zeroes, and trying to find the perfect shade for column borders.</p>

<p>And, since you made it this far, here’s how the numbers above look in the real world:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/cleveland-trip-backpack-on-off.png" title="Side by side pictures of a packed backpack: open and closed." ></p>

<p>Hopefully you found this useful, or at least somewhat entertaining. There’s a lot of room for improvement, and I aimed to provide a framework and a few basic ideas for building a spreadsheet to accommodate one’s twisted ultralight needs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I really like Octopress. It builds on top of Jekyll to address certain rough edges, and provides ready to go lighting fast blogging platform. It&rsquo;s easily extendible if you know how to code (thanks to a rather clean and well organized code base), and posts are just plain Markdown files.</p>

<p>One issue though - I need to be near a computer to publish and preview the article. This becomes difficult if I&rsquo;m traveling with, say, a tablet.</p>

<p>I have a low end AWS Lightsail instance I use for writing and publishing, but it&rsquo;s not always fun to write when SSHing into a server, and I often write offline - making it even more difficult to move files between where I write and where I publish. And managing images is a nightmare. To resolve this, I set up a few directories I use in Dropbox, and wrote a few scripts to move things around when needed.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a directory structure in Dropbox:</p>

<pre><code>- blog/
  - posts/
    - 2017-11-20-automatic-octopress-publishing.markdown
  - img/
    - input/
      - a-picture-of-a-flower.jpg
    - output/
</code></pre>

<p>I put Markdown files in <code>Dropbox/blog/posts/</code> (and numerous offline editors sync with Dropbox - I&rsquo;m writing this with <a href="https://stackedit.io/app">StackEdit</a>, and I use <a href="https://ia.net/writer/">iA Writer</a> on my tablet). I add my images to <code>Dropbox/img/input/</code>. I  tend to strip metadata from my images and resize them to fit the maximum page width (I don&rsquo;t really care for high resolution pictures, speed is preferred over ability to zoom into a picture). For this, two tools are needed:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install imagemagick exiftool
</code></pre>

<p>When I&rsquo;m done writing or want to preview an article, I SSH into my AWS Lightsail instance and run <code>sync.sh</code>, a small script which moves posts to a proper directory, processes images and places them in the desired location, as well as starts Octopress instance (this way I can preview my blog on the AWS Lightsail instance). Contents of <code>sync.sh</code> (don&rsquo;t forget to <code>chmod +x</code>):</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
cd $HOME/Dropbox/blog/img/input
mogrify -resize 832x620 -quality 100 -path $HOME/Dropbox/blog/img/output *.jpg
exiftool -all= $HOME/Dropbox/blog/img/output/*.jpg
cp $HOME/Dropbox/blog/posts/*.markdown $HOME/blog/source/_posts
cp $HOME/Dropbox/blog/img/output/*.jpg $HOME/blog/source/images/posts
cd $HOME/blog
rake generate
rake preview
</code></pre>

<p>I run the above script every time I want to preview the site. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s easy to set up a daemon to watch for changes in the Dropbox folders, but I don&rsquo;t see the need for that yet. Also, I just statically resize images to a particular resolution (832x620) since all of the pictures I upload have the same aspect ratio, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a way to calculate that number on the fly for this script to work with different aspect ratios.</p>

<p>Lastly, when I deployed and committed my changes (still commit and deploy manually out of a habit), I run <code>archive.sh</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
mv $HOME/Dropbox/blog/posts/*.markdown $HOME/Dropbox/blog/published
rm $HOME/Dropbox/blog/img/input/*
rm $HOME/Dropbox/blog/img/output/*
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s not much, but enough to save some manual labor involved in publishing to Octopress.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p><em>This article is a collaboration between my partner and I.</em></p>

<p>Since moving into a studio, I have missed the freedom of taking off randomly, getting to know a different city or state and overall not being tied down to a routine or a location. I love the idea of trivializing travel, so it was only natural to have a random trip at the end of the week.</p>

<p>My partner watches <a href="http://www.thebucketlistfamily.com/">The Bucket List Family</a> on a weekly basis and caught the traveling bug as well. Unfortunately, we are not yet at the level where we can afford a 5 star trip to international locals or have companies pay for our travels (one day!). Our goal was to spend a few days going out of state to break the work week and avoid living for the weekend.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/prius-ready-for-trip-to-slc.jpg" title="Ready for the trip to Salt Lake City." ></p>

<p>We decided to leave Northern California on Thursday afternoon for Salt Lake City, Utah as soon as we were done with work. Roughly 800 miles each way, if one counts exits and driving around sightseeing. Inspired by an acquaintance who travels the world with a folding bike, my partner and we took our bikes with us: a borrowed Brompton folding bike for my partner in the back seat, and my <a href="http://amzn.to/2xT6xT7">ZycleFix Prime</a> mounted on the rack in the rear.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/brompton-bike-in-the-backseat.jpg" title="Brompton bike in the backseat." ></p>

<p>Driving through California, Nevada, and Utah on I-80 was always one of my favorites - and it was nice to share the wonders of the world with my partner. She clocked in a lot more international travel than I did, but only been to a handful of states. It was her first time in Utah and each stop on the way to the Salt Flats exposed us to all kinds of people, different from the type of individuals we typically see inside the Silicon Valley tech bubble. We saw people with different lives, habits, hobbies, and worldviews, which to be perfectly honest, was refreshing.</p>

<p>Throughout the trip, we made it a point not to make any plans and go with the flow &ndash; be it our driving pace, entertainment or food options, or cities we decided to stay the night in. Traveling that way removed the stress associated with finding the perfect location and planning a fun trip. Don’t like the town we stopped at? Let’s keep driving. Enjoy a specific city? Let’s spend the night there. Having issues at a hotel? Back on the road we go.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/beautiful-sky-on-our-way.jpg" title="Beautiful sky as we’re driving on I-80." ></p>

<p>We found a hotel while driving on the I-80 and settled there for the night. Unfortunately the place did not have a strong enough WiFi, which led us to drive to the next town over for coffee and internet to work remotely. We ended up spending 6 hours in the coffee shop making sure that we kept ourselves well caffeinated and the servers well tipped. After a somewhat productive day, we decided to explore the city’s downtown and save the Salt Flats drive for the daytime.</p>

<p>Our Super 8 Motel in Wendover cost us around $70 for the night and was more comfortable than expected. We ended up passing out as soon as we got to the room, exhausted from the day. We tried to stay at cheaper hotels/motels, while avoiding shady looking places. We would most often pick the 2nd or 3rd cheapest option. We never stayed in one place for more than a night and lucked out every time we got ourselves a room. Every room we slept in was clean and we even managed to squeeze in a daily workout before the start of each day.</p>

<p>Keeping a healthy diet on the other hand was a whole other challenge. Between cafes, restaurants and late night cravings, we failed at maintaining proper eating habits and saving on food. We spent around $300 on food alone. Eating is definitely one area for improvement, especially as we decide to travel more. Dieting is hard and dieting on the road is even harder.</p>

<p>On Saturday, we finally headed to Utah and stopped at a rest stop by the Salt Flats. The view was marvelous and cold for an October day. We left the Salt Flats for a mall, City Creek Center, in Salt Lake City where we had another amazingly delicious and unhealthy lunch. To feel better about our life choices, we used our bikes to get some cardio and discover the city on two-wheels. We biked through Memory Grove Park, crashed a wedding, and biked almost to the Capitol. Almost. Due to Salt Lake’s incredible, deadly hills. Next time, SLC, next time we shall conquer you.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/salt-flats-are-gorgeous.jpg" title="Beautiful Salt Flats." ></p>

<p>After a day of biking and testing each other&rsquo;s patience, we decided to go for a date night and talk through our attempts at making life on the road work. Traveling solo is a very different experience than traveling with a partner. We chatted over Brazilian BBQ, another unhealthy choice, and agreed that we needed to include time alone as part of our travel routine and constantly check in with each other.</p>

<p>We headed to the hotel and decided to leave back for California after breakfast on Sunday. Oh, and on the topic of car, the subject of staying in the Prius or camping came up a few times. We even prepared our tents in that event but the cold weather and the thought of a hot shower took priority&hellip; Oh well, hotel Prius will get more use some other time.</p>

<p>In one day, we drove from Utah back to Northern California. We have different memories of the road back. For her, it was long and slow. For me as a driver, it passed within a blink of an eye. Overall, our trip to Utah was a success and we learned a lot:</p>

<ol>
<li>Nothing can replace the freedom associated with the absence of a plan. When there&rsquo;s no agenda or times to be at specific places - you&rsquo;re never late, never in a hurry, and you&rsquo;ve always seen more than you planned for. It allowed us to be surprised and delighted by places we encountered without imposing our pace on said locations.</li>
<li>Taking time for oneself is a necessity when traveling with someone else. Time alone does not always mean actually being alone. It can be whatever works for you as a couple. For us, it’s spending time on our devices while sitting next to each other.</li>
<li>Approaching each location with an open mind. You are not always going to get to travel to exotic <a href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/him-and-her-whats-inside-the-bag/">places like the Bahamas</a>, but the opportunity to fall in love with a place or its people is always there.</li>
</ol>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Living in a car for nearly a year made me pick up number of travel-related skills, here and there. Having limited available space forced &ldquo;less is more&rdquo; philosophy on me, and it&rsquo;s something I carried over into more stationary life. Right now I&rsquo;m taking a break from car dwelling and living in a small apartment in Bay Area. It didn&rsquo;t stop my love for travel though, as I&rsquo;m writing this entry on my flight to Nassau, Bahamas. 5 days at the destination, leisure. One of the many weekends I&rsquo;m not home.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/two-backpacks-on-a-bed.jpg" title="Both of our backpacks, bigger is hers." ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not traveling alone this time, and my traveling partner has a similar outlook on travel.</p>

<h2>Him</h2>

<p>Less is more. Every trip starts with packing. I use my <a href="http://amzn.to/2xHIV2F">eBags Motherlode Weekender backpack</a>, which is about the perfect size for me when it&rsquo;s compressed tightly. I can probably fit in double the stuff I packed in the backpack, but I love having room in case I pick something up at the destination.</p>

<p>I never have to check in my bag, and it&rsquo;s light enough to carry on my back without any strain. I can explore my destination as soon as I arrive, without the need to find arrangement for my bags.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/his-opened-backpack.jpg" title="My backpack, open." ></p>

<p>I pack minimally, only having two-three sets of each type of clothing. I hand-wash the clothes I wear before I go to bed. I cycle through a total of 3 pairs of undergarments - most dry overnight as I sleep.</p>

<p>Furthermore, all my outfits can be mixed and matched together, so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about pairing tops, bottoms, and shoes. I like to think I have some sense of style to, for those wondering. Most people I meet won&rsquo;t likely see me for more then one-two days in a row, and those who do are not likely to pay attention to my small wardrobe - as long as it looks clean and sharp.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what the clothing items for this trip look like:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/his-stuff-inside-the-backpack.jpg" title="Clothing items inside the backpack." ></p>

<ul>
<li>Business-casual dress-shirt.</li>
<li>Two T-shirts.</li>
<li>Pair of shorts.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2zpE3Bf">Icebreaker merino underwear</a>, 2 pairs.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2xHk92J">Darn Tough socks</a>, 2 pairs.</li>
<li>Jacket.</li>
<li>Swimming trunks.</li>
<li>Travel towel, for the beach.</li>
<li>Flip flops.</li>
<li>Workout outfit:

<ul>
<li>Tank top.</li>
<li>Shorts.</li>
<li>Sports underwear.</li>
<li>Running sneakers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>All of the above is contained within a single <a href="http://amzn.to/2yLgwxz">packing cube</a> and a travel shoe bag.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t sound like a lot, but it&rsquo;s plenty (add the outfit I&rsquo;m wearing on the plane - pants, T-shirt, sweater, shoes, pair of underwear, socks). The above lets me have outfits for all kinds of events, activities, and anticipated weather at the destination.</p>

<p>My personal hygiene stuff fits in a dettachable bag which comes with the backpack. Not much special here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Toothbrushes.</li>
<li>Toothpaste.</li>
<li>Floss.</li>
<li>Deodorant.</li>
<li>Hairbrush.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2zrcN5t">Quick dry scrub net</a>.</li>
<li>Contact lenses.</li>
</ul>


<p>For entertainment and downtime I have my trusty Google Pixel C (with attached keyboard) and a pair of cheap apple ear buds. Bonus point for USB C standard - I only need to use a single charger for my tablet and a phone.</p>

<h2>Her</h2>

<p>Traveling with a space obsessed partner <em>(him: Hey!)</em> has forced me to look at packing in a different way. I first experimented with the idea of minimalism after watching The BucketList Family and avoiding airline fees is always a bonus. With every trips, I refined my set up. While I am not as lightweight and nimble as my partner, I have made significant improvements to my travel routine and picked up a few tips and tricks from him.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/her-opened-backpack.jpg" title="Her backpack, open." ></p>

<p>For example, the <a href="http://amzn.to/2zbhUG2">eBag Weekender</a> was my first real travel purchase, which I made sure to always have ready for use, meaning that it&rsquo;s always stocked with toiletries, travel documents and packing cubes. Given my propensity for sweating, I upgraded to a <a href="http://amzn.to/2yLgwxz">clean/dirty packing cube</a> and a <a href="http://amzn.to/2hJibsQ">charcoal odor remover</a> for my workout outfit.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/her-packing-cubes.jpg" title="Her packing cubes in a backpack." ></p>

<p>For this trip, this is what is inside my bag including the clothes I am wearing to travel:</p>

<p>On me:</p>

<ul>
<li>A tank top.</li>
<li>A hoodie.</li>
<li>A denim jacket.</li>
<li>Lululemon leggings.</li>
<li>Bra and underwear.</li>
<li>Sandals</li>
</ul>


<p>In my luggage:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/her-stuff-inside-the-backpack.jpg" title="What's in her luggage." ></p>

<ul>
<li>Button on shirt.</li>
<li>Tank top.</li>
<li>T-shirt.</li>
<li>Pair of pants.</li>
<li>Pair of shorts.</li>
<li>Rain jacket.</li>
<li>5 pairs of underwear (one is never too prepared in terms of underwear, and this is where I refuse to become a minimalist).</li>
<li>Workout oufit:

<ul>
<li>Leggings.</li>
<li>Dry fit T-shirt.</li>
<li>One pair of socks.</li>
<li>Workout bra.</li>
<li>Sports sneakers.</li>
<li>Bikini</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Toiletries:</p>

<ul>
<li>Foundation.</li>
<li>Makeup brush.</li>
<li>Travel-friendly lotion.</li>
<li>Natural oil for face washing purposes.</li>
<li>Feminine hygiene soap</li>
<li>Ingrown hair serum.</li>
<li>L&#8217;Instant de Guerlain perfume (while the current bottle takes a lot of space and adds weight, I have yet to find a travel friendly way to carry it).</li>
</ul>


<p>If you haven&rsquo;t noticed, my backpack is bigger, and my setup is a bit heavier. To be perfectly honest, I am not yet fully on board with this whole minimalistic travel but I have got to say, my shoulders are thankful.</p>

<h2>Making Yourself at Home</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve learned from <a href="http://thebucketlistfamily.com">the bucket list family</a> that it&rsquo;s really important to unpack as soon as we get to a hotel. Especially since it&rsquo;s easy to do when there&rsquo;s little clothing in the bags. This way we feel at home whenever we go, even if we&rsquo;re just staying at a hotel for a single night. Every item is in it&rsquo;s place, and there&rsquo;s no digging through the bags for clothes or gadgets.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/our-hotel-in-nassau-bahamas.jpg" title="Our hotel in Nassau, Bahamas." ></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve also found that we really value downtime, every day we travel. Taking time to unwind (however long it needs to be) in the hotel room, a coffee shop, or anywhere else helps take the edge off flying and booking accommodations and the subconscious pressure to have fun as a pair.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve learned this the hard way on our first trip together. Our days were packed with activities and sightseeing stops, and we were at each other&rsquo;s throats by the end of the trip. Lesson learned.</p>
