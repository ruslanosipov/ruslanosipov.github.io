  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I recently found an interesting way to organize random bits of information: a
personal Wiki. It&rsquo;s a great idea to have data repository shared between your
machines: important notes about people, conversations, events, tasks you&rsquo;ve
accomplished, thoughts, and a hundred of little pieces of knowledge which don&rsquo;t
belong anywhere else. There is plenty of software out there which lets you set
up a personal Wiki, and some of it is very lightweight and well polished.
However, I prefer to do most of my editing and writing in Vim. As tip #22 from
&ldquo;The Pragmatic Programmer&rdquo; states:</p>

<blockquote><p>Use a single editor well</p>

<p>We think it is better to know one editor very well, and use it for all
editing tasks: code, documentation, memos, system administration, and so
on. Without a single editor, you face a potential modern day Babel of
confusion.</p></blockquote>

<p>I fully agree with the above statement and I try to use one editor for the
majority of tasks which require typing, without having to remember which editor
contains certain features, and which doesn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s one of the main reasons I
went with <code>vimwiki</code> - a lightweight and clean personal Wiki with it&rsquo;s own
Wiki-style markdown. Oh, <code>vimwiki</code> also subscribes to another tip from &ldquo;The
Pragmatic Programmer&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote><p>Keep knowledge in plain text</p></blockquote>

<p>The <code>vimwiki</code> plugin has a number of interesting and useful features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Memorable mappings for moving in and out of Wikis. Hit <code>&lt;leader&gt;ww</code> and you
are on the home page of your Wiki. The <code>&lt;leader&gt;wt</code> will open the Wiki in a
new tab: the rest of the mappings are as intuitive.</li>
<li>Multiple Wikis support: really handy if you have a number of separate
projects for which you want to keep separate entries.</li>
<li>Diary-like quick notes. You can create an instant page for today by hitting
<code>&lt;leader&gt;w&lt;leader&gt;w</code>. Combination <code>&lt;leader&gt;wi</code> brings you to a diary home
page, and <code>&lt;leader&gt;w&lt;leader&gt;i</code> re-indexes the diary entries.</li>
<li>Easy link creation: hit enter on a word and it will turn into a link to
another page. Hitting enter on a link will transport you to the destination
page. Simply surrounding text with double square brackets (<code>[[]]</code>) works as
well.</li>
<li>Navigation: enter to follow a link, backspace to go back.</li>
<li>You can convert all your records into html by executing <code>:VimwikiAll2HTML</code>.</li>
<li>Extensive and well written help file. Just run <code>:help vimwiki</code> and start
reading.</li>
</ul>


<p>The list can go on forever, but these are the features I found to be the most
useful.</p>

<p>In order to enjoy synchronization between all my machines, I hosted my Wiki in
a Dropbox folder - <code>vimwiki</code> lets you specify locations from each one of your
Wikis.</p>

<pre><code>let g:vimwiki_list = [{'path': '$HOME/Dropbox/wiki'}]
</code></pre>

<p>Download it from the GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki">https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/zero-mail-inbox/" itemprop="url">Zero mail inbox</a></h2>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I use email a lot. Maybe not as much as some, but I receive and send a fair
share of mail each day. You might find it odd, but I love using email. It&rsquo;s a
pleasant and calm experience, and sorting through a pile of messages every
morning rewards me with a sense of achievement. There are, however, few tricks
I have up my sleeve, and I would like to share them today. These tips will not
necessarily make you more productive, but they will provide you a with a more
pleasant and peaceful experience of managing your inbox.</p>

<p>But first, I would like to set the scene&hellip;</p>

<h2>The wonderful Mailbox app</h2>

<p>I started using iOS email client called <a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com">Mailbox</a> a little over a year ago,
shortly after a release. Back then, before it was acquired by Dropbox, you had
to wait in order for the company to grow their servers. I patiently waited &ldquo;in
line&rdquo; for almost a month and I finally was able to transfer all my accounts to
this wonderful mail client.</p>

<p>It was worth waiting for. Right after starting, Mailbox archived all the
conversations in my inbox, and presented me with a list of unread emails which
looked an awful lot like a To-Do list. You can read and reply, archive the
important letters, delete junk, or resend a conversation to yourself after a
certain time span as a reminder. This is an extremely simple idea, but it is
essentially what anyone&rsquo;s inbox is: a list of things which need to be done.
Some emails have to be replied to, some have to be acted upon in some other
way. The ones that don&rsquo;t get archived are deleted right away.</p>

<p>Mailbox turned my trash-filled inbox into a clean list of items I need to do.
Since then, there never was an email I forgot to reply to, nor an important
thing I forgot to do. Inbox can be referred to as &ldquo;To Do&rdquo;, and an archive as
&ldquo;Done&rdquo;. This scheme makes it nearly impossible to miss anything of importance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Mailbox is an iOS-only application, and I started noticing the
shortcomings of the desktop experience. And I do use desktop mail far more
often than mobile. I decided to have a set of rules for managing my inbox; and
this is the workflow I have been successfully using for over a year.</p>

<h2>Workflow outside of the Mailbox app</h2>

<p><img src="/images/posts/zero-mail-inbox-in-gmail.png" title="Having clean inbox is rewarding." ></p>

<p>I only use Gmail, and there probably are ways to have the same experience on
other platforms. However, the Mailbox app works only with Gmail.</p>

<p>The first thing which needs to be done in order to start using the zero mail
inbox workflow - is to empty it from all the read mail. Thankfully, the Mailbox
app archives all your previous conversations the moment you install it.</p>

<p>Next, there has to be a way to implement a &ldquo;snooze&rdquo; button. There are always
times when you can&rsquo;t reply to an email, but don&rsquo;t exactly want to keep it in
your inbox (what an eyesore). Gmail does not provide a native way to resend
your emails at later times, but I found a Chrome extension called
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snooze-your-email-for-gma/pbmfoncgccdhoknelpglaacbgkclcape">&ldquo;Snooze Your Email for Gmail&rdquo;</a>, which adds a simple &ldquo;Snooze&rdquo; button to the
Gmail UI.</p>

<p>Now that these two things are taken care of, there is a simple set of rules to
be used when a new email comes in:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Delete.</em> Is it a notification? Does it require saving for future
reference? A lot of things should be deleted. Bills, notifications,
messages from robots: these don&rsquo;t have to be saved. Items in Gmail trash
live for 30 days, which is enough time to find something in case of an
emergency. In addition, most of this information is available from some
another source anyway.</li>
<li><em>Snooze.</em> Do you have time right now to read/reply/act upon this email?
Remind yourself about it in a few hours or days instead.</li>
<li><em>Archive.</em> Conversation with a real person you might want to reference to
later? I save all the email chains from humans, just in case I have to
search through them at a later date.</li>
<li><em>Reply and archive.</em> Self-explanatory. Act upon and save for future
reference.</li>
<li><em>Let it be.</em> This is an eyesore version of using the &ldquo;Snooze&rdquo; button. You
usually want to do this only if there are more important emails to read and
act upon before getting to this one.</li>
</ul>


<p>Ideally, when you keep items in your inbox - this means they have to be acted
upon in some way. There is no reason not to archive or delete conversations
which don&rsquo;t require actions.</p>

<h2>Bonus point: labels</h2>

<p>This is a recent addition to my repertoire. I found myself often searching
through certain sets of email, and hence Gmail does not support regular
expressions it&rsquo;s quite a big pain in the neck for me when I can&rsquo;t remember
certain details. I created a set of thematic labels, which group emails by
projects, products, and teams. And I started religiously assigning them to all
the emails I archive. First it takes a bit of work, but after a while it
becomes easy to identify a pattern and create filters to assist yourself with
categorization.</p>

<p>As a result, I can  narrow down a search to a thematic subset of emails, saving
myself a lot of time and frustration.</p>

      <h2 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/dark-side-of-technical-interviews/" itemprop="url">Dark side of technical interviews</a></h2>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>It upsets me greatly, since there is no immediate or obvious solution to an
interviewing scheme which will fit every company. Some companies seem to find
processes which work for their size and culture, while others struggle to do
so. Human resources management is a complex subject, and it&rsquo;s hard to get
right.</p>

<p>I have experience with only a small subset of interviewing techniques, but none
of the following interview components I employ seem satisfactory.</p>

<h2>Screening</h2>

<p>Screenings are usually done by recruiters, employees whose skills are in
seeking and evaluating prospective assets to the company. The first problem
here is that <em>recruiters are not team members</em>. Recruiters might do a really
good job at, say, finding good recruiters - since this is their domain, and
something they are inherently good at. But they don&rsquo;t develop software.
Recruiters don&rsquo;t work with tech leads and team members, they don&rsquo;t have the
slightest real life idea what managers and leaders want from the potential
hire. Hell, the problem is - most team leads don&rsquo;t even know what kind of
person they need. And if they do, they don&rsquo;t have a slightest idea on how to
communicate this properly to the recruiters.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, software engineers and team leads would do recruiting
themselves. But this way they would not have time to do their own job, and
would thus become recruiters. Boom, the company lost a good software engineer.
So you end up hiring recruiters, who have not the slightest idea what a team
needs (&ldquo;person has to be proficient in Blah-blah-blah&rdquo; is like saying that a
writer has to be an expert at writing about red cubes).</p>

<p>Is there a solution? Probably, maybe, I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe recruiters and
software engineers have to communicate more. Set up meetings to discuss team
needs, go through training in regards to identifying key traits in prospective
engineers. Teams of engineers have to communicate their preferences better.
Engineers are hired to fit the culture, not to be a &ldquo;rock star&rdquo;. Geniuses don&rsquo;t
go through the HR process, future team members do.</p>

<h2>Interview with another engineer</h2>

<p>This, even though it has a good intent, is a big whopping failure. What this
originally is meant to do - is have a potential colleague evaluate the
candidate. Sounds like a fantastic idea in theory, and sometimes it even works
the way it is intended to.</p>

<p>Most of the time, however, you end up with a competition-driven technological
fanatic bombarding an interviewee with smart-ass obscure trick questions they
discovered that one time browsing their favorite language&rsquo;s mailing lists from
the year 1990. In the worst-case scenario, the candidate is not able to answer
any of those terrible questions, satisfying the interviewer&rsquo;s ego while she
cranks out a negative report to a recruiter.</p>

<p>In a slightly better version, an engineer will give a candidate a set of
hands-on tasks which rarely have anything to do with the real job
responsibilities. One version of this: pair programming segment, on the
engineer&rsquo;s machine, under stress and with shaking hands. Are we hiring
contestants for a hackathon?</p>

<p>When it comes to software engineering, everyone suddenly forgets that writing
code is the smallest portion of the day. This might not be the case for junior
programmers, but they are not the ones companies are wasting their hiring
resources on. It&rsquo;s the mid-level and senior workers who weren&rsquo;t even evaluated
on half of their job responsibilities. How are their human interaction skills?
Are they pleasant to work with? Will they have issues with company policies?
<em>Will they fit?</em> These questions are as important as one&rsquo;s ability to put
together a few lines of code.</p>

<p>Maybe interviewers have to spend less time checking how well candidates write
code under pressure, and more time evaluating if they will be a good match for
the company&rsquo;s culture. How do they react when you point out their mistake? Can
they communicate concepts clearly? Are they good at marketing themselves? You
hire people, not code generating machines. Unless that&rsquo;s what you need, of
course.</p>

<h2>Home assignments</h2>

<p>Home assignments are something I personally like and despise and the same time.
And I find it sad that there are a number of big fat minuses with this
approach. First, one might find it insulting. &ldquo;What, I have to write code for
you in my own time? Couldn&rsquo;t you evaluate me on an interview or something?&rdquo;
This method can turn a lot of people off, and unfortunately the ones that stay
are not typically the best quality.</p>

<p>As my co-worker wisely pointed out, if you have a choice between two overall
equal companies and one requires you to do more work before being considered -
you will naturally pick one that accepts you easier. Any job seeker would feel
more appreciated and trusted taking that route.</p>

<p>The honesty factor doesn&rsquo;t play much role here, since you usually can tell if
the person did not write everything herself during the one-on-one followup. But
the cost does play a role. The interviewer has to come up with a relatively
unique assignment, spend time reading and evaluating the written program, give
feedback on a follow-up interview. This adds up if you have many candidates.</p>

<p>This technique does make sense when the list of candidates needs to be narrowed
down, or when you&rsquo;re at the top of your domain. Who wouldn&rsquo;t complete a
day-long homework for Google? Many people will happily spend a sleepless night
for an employment opportunity. Even more wouldn&rsquo;t, especially if someone has a
number of options lined up in front of them.</p>

<h2>What about other methods?</h2>

<p>There is a large number of various interviewing techniques out there. Some
companies combine the above specified methods to have a bare-bone hiring
template. Some make candidates do paid work for a few weeks before being
accepted as a new hire. Some don&rsquo;t bother and just decide to wing it.</p>

<p>This is still a developing area; I am afraid the solution has to be obtained
through the method of trial and error. There seems to be no success recipe
which works for everyone. There are, however, a number of alternative
solutions. I don&rsquo;t think most companies put enough resources in finding a
successful technique, instead opting for whatever method is in season at the
moment.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>You might wonder what an English language style guide from 1918 is doing in a
software engineering blog. You might even get angry at me for pointing this
book in your face. But I have a strong affection towards this guide; I believe
everyone who has to write more than a sentence in English should read it. I
like to emphasize the communication aspects of a software engineering career as
much as coding or management skills.</p>

<p>English is not my native language, and I often struggle with the writing style.
I found a number of style tips online and in the books I read, but lately I
noticed a pattern: most of those tips referenced &ldquo;The Elements Of Style&rdquo;. The
book is available online free of charge (copyright has expired; it is now in
public domain) and takes only an evening to read.</p>

<p>What the book gives you is invaluable writing advice. The author provides
concrete style rules targeted at increasing the appeal and comprehension rates
of your text. Here&rsquo;s my favorite piece of advice:</p>

<blockquote><p>13. Omit needless words.</p>

<p>Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary
words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a
drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary
parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or
that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that
he make every word tell.</p></blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://amzn.to/1v6keFG">The Elements Of Style</a>&rdquo; is a timeless classic; it should be mandatory
reading for every speaker or learner of English out there. I immediately
applied the rules to technical documentation, email communication, and even
this very blog entry. I will probably have to read through the guide multiple
times over the course of the following months in order to ensure maximum
retention. If you care about being understood by another human being, you
should read it too.</p>
