    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past year or two I&rsquo;ve been working in the cloud. I use Chrome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en">Secure Shell</a> to connect to my machines, and it works rather well. In fact, I moved away from my work Linux/Mac laptops towards an <a href="http://amzn.to/2hv68Ck">HP Chromebook</a>, which fullfilled both requirements I had: a browser and a terminal. One thing I missed about a Linux machine though is lack of <code>notify-send</code>-like functionality, especially when working with long-running builds.</p>

<p>Yesterday I pinged hterm team for assistance with this matter, and turns out recent release of Secure Shell supports Chrome desktop notifications! Furthermore, two amazing engineers (thanks Andrew and Mike!) crafted an <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/601549/3/hterm/etc/hterm-notify.sh">hterm-notify</a> script, which propagates notifications to Chrome, and by extent to desktop!</p>

<p>I made a few tiny changes, mainly since I don&rsquo;t use <code>screen</code>, and tmux sets my <code>$TERM</code> to <code>screen-256color</code> for some reason:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
# Copyright 2017 The Chromium OS Authors. All rights reserved.
# Use of this source code is governed by a BSD-style license that can be
# found in the LICENSE file.

# Write an error message and exit.
# Usage: &lt;message&gt;
die() {
  echo "ERROR: $*"
  exit 1
}

# Send a notification.
# Usage: [title] [body]
notify() {
  local title="${1-}" body="${2-}"

  case ${TERM-} in
  screen*)  # This one's really tmux
    printf '\ePtmux;\e\e]777;notify;%s;%s\a\e\\' "${title}" "${body}"
    ;;
  *)        # This one's plain hterm
    printf '\e]777;notify;%s;%s\a' "${title}" "${body}"
    ;;
  esac
}

# Write tool usage and exit.
# Usage: [error message]
usage() {
  if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then
    exec 1&gt;&amp;2
  fi
  cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Usage: hterm-notify [options] &lt;title&gt; [body]

Send a notification to hterm.

Notes:
- The title should not have a semi-colon in it.
- Neither field should have escape sequences in them.
  Best to stick to plain text.
EOF

  if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then
    echo
    die "$@"
  else
    exit 0
  fi
}

main() {
  set -e

  while [ $# -gt 0 ]; do
    case $1 in
    -h|--help)
      usage
      ;;
    -*)
      usage "Unknown option: $1"
      ;;
    *)
      break
      ;;
    esac
  done

  if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    die "Missing message to send"
  fi
  if [ $# -gt 2 ]; then
    usage "Too many arguments"
  fi

  notify "$@"
}
main "$@"
</code></pre>

<p>Throwing this in as <code>~/bin/notify</code> (not forgetting to <code>chmod +x</code> and having <code>~/bin</code> in the <code>$PATH</code>) I can get a notification when a particular long running command is complete:</p>

<pre><code>sleep 30 &amp;&amp; notify Hooray "The sleep's done!"
</code></pre>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>A close friend of mine has a story similar to mine. She wanted to share it for a while now, and I&rsquo;m humbled she chose my blog as a medium for telling her inspiring story to the strangers on the Internet:</em></p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/friends-trip-plane.jpg" title="At Narita Airport, Japan." ></p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t count the number of times I have attempted to tell this story on paper. It all started 8 months ago when my then-husband, let&rsquo;s call him Carl, told me that he no longer loved me and was in love with someone else. There are a few moments in life that seem to happen in slow motion and this was one of them. Until then, my life had been being Carl&rsquo;s wife and in the blink of an eye, I had to figure out who I was in a world without Carl. I forced myself to write every thoughts I had, dark, depressed, once a day but it didn&rsquo;t stick. I bought various domain names hoping that it would give me the final push to start writing all this down but all the sites remained &ldquo;under construction&rdquo;. So here is my final attempt to write this up, organize my thoughts and hopefully let someone going through this know that they are not alone. How did I get here? Well funny you should ask, pull up a chair and listen to my tale.</p>

<p>Carl and I met when we were 22 and 18 respectively. It was far from love at first sight but he intrigued me. I had just got out of an unhealthy relationship and wanted something different and Carl was that, unapologetically himself. Up until then, I had always felt pressure to conform to the idea of who others wanted me to be and meeting Carl, who let&rsquo;s be honest was a straight nerd, was surprisingly refreshing and attractive. We dated for 5 years before getting married. We struggled with money throughout the first years of our relationship so when the opportunity to make more at a job I was unqualified for presented itself, we jumped at the chance. We packed our bags and moved for my job. Thus started the beginning of the end. I was so focused on keeping said job that I overworked, became a ball of nerves and lost all desires to do anything outside of work. While I struggled with the demand of the job, Carl found refuge with his younger, funner coworkers. We started living separate lives, which eventually led up to the fateful day when my husband told me that he loved someone else.</p>

<p>I will not bore you with the details of my attempts to become a stable, contributing member of society. It included a lot of sleepless night, Nutella for dinner, and lies. I would smile everyday as I got to work, joked with co-workers and call family members and friends to discuss everything and anything when deep down all I wanted to do was to crawl in a dark place and wallow in my sadness. This period led to a lot of physical and mental changes. I lost 20 pounds in 2 months due to stress but the vain person in me was happy to see myself get skinny. Mentally, I had to come clean to my family and explain to them how I became the first divorced person in a deeply catholic family. I created a smaller, more dependable community of friends, most of them divorced or separated who could provide me with a different perspective. I had to admit to my manager that I could not continue work as is. Maintaining the lies became exhausting and emotionally draining. One had to give and after a heart to heart with my manager, I decided to cash out all my vacation hours and head out to Southeast Asia for a month.</p>

<p>Prior to Southeast Asia, I had never vacationed alone. For the first time in my life, I was in charge of my itinerary and my own entertainment. It was overwhelming. After discussing the trip with veteran solo travelers, I only purchased one ticket. All I knew was my departing and arrival date from and to the US. I arrived at my first stop, Ho Chi Minh City, at midnight on a blazing hot night. The bustle of the city took me aback and made me question the trip in its entirety. I was running away and I knew it. I have always thought of myself as a strong person but dealing with this separation made me feel like a scared kid. Just as I was going through this mental exercise, my cab driver hit a motorcyclist and the impact broke one of his side view mirrors. The driver angrily got out of the car and argued with the individual he had just hit. They spoke in Vietnamese for what felt like hours and came back without explanations. At that point, I was sure that this entire trip was a mistake and if I had spoken the language, I would have asked the driver to turn and drop me back at the airport.</p>

<p>The rest of the drive to the hotel was much calmer with the occasional surprise looks from locals seeing a black tourist through a taxi window at midnight. Blame it on stress, jet lag or even regret but for the first time in months I slept for more than 4 hours. Somewhat invigorated by the night of sleep, I decided to venture into the city to find food. After multiple failed attempts to cross one of the main traffic arteries, I gave up and sat down miserably looking at a bowl of pho from a restaurant located in the same block as my hotel. The Ho Chi Minh City traffic had won once again. I sat by a window seat, staring into the street, dreading the rest of this Southeast Asia trip. To travel Asia required an adventure spirit and it only took me 2 days to recognize that this was not one of my hidden talents. I told myself, only half believing it, that my second stop might be different but deep down, I knew I was on my way to yet another disappointing time.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/friends-trip-sleep.png" title="Screenshot of sleep activity during the trip." ></p>

<p>Bangkok was a life changing stop for my trip and myself as a person. I had contacted a Turkish-based traveler on CouchSurfing visiting Bangkok during the same time. I was excited to meet up with someone that could understand the struggles of being in an unfamiliar country. This guy learned English by watching American sitcoms but did not let his basic knowledge of English or his lack of Thai stop him. It led to some interesting conversations about the meaning of &ldquo;Netflix and Chill&rdquo; and other American colloquialisms. Seeing him tackle the challenges of navigating a foreign city showed me what my journey could look like. Not only did he help me see the wonders of being open to the world, but he also inadvertently started my process of self love. Let me explain. To avoid having to carry a heavy suitcase and pay airline fees, I limited my wardrobe to whatever could fit in a carry-on backpack. As a relatively fashion-focused person, this decision was uncomfortable. With that in mind and the unforgiving sun, I was either dripped in sweat or looking like a lost 1920s explorer. Having someone still think that I looked good in those conditions did wonders for my broken self esteem. We spend 4 adventures filled days and parted ways. We still talk to each other and I am grateful to have encountered him so early on during my trip. I finally embraced the lack of structure and decided to thrive through it. Remember this word &ldquo;Thrive&rdquo;, it will come back later on in this story.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/friends-trip-construction.jpg" title="Temple in Bangkok." ></p>

<p>After Bangkok, I headed to Chiang Mai for the Lantern Festival. Given my positive experience with CouchSurfing, I decided to continue using it  to meet locals and travelers throughout my stops. I used all the lessons learned in Bangkok and forced myself to open up to people. I had a heart wrenching conversation with an American girl trying to find herself in the world despite familial and societal pressures. We quickly bonded and within minutes were sharing our deepest darkest fears. In addition to looking differently at people, I started focusing on things that made me happy. I took a Thai cooking class, a skill I desperately lacked in, and learned Muay Thai. With each new activity I undertook, I felt a change inside of me. I was slowly starting to fall in love with myself.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/friends-trip-market.jpg" title="Cooking class in Chiang Mai." ></p>

<p>Next stop: Singapore. A few coworkers happened to be there around the same time and I had always been intrigued by the country. I experienced the country&rsquo;s renowned cleanliness, mix of cultures and wide array of food options. It was in Singapore that I learned another fact about myself: I loved meeting new people. I struck conversations with random people in elevators, buses or hotels. Not having an itinerary turned out to be a blessing. I ended up extending my time in Singapore and enjoyed some retail therapy from one of the cities&#8217; amazing malls.</p>

<p>My goal for this trip was not only self discovery but also to be fully emerged in each country’s history and culture. So that meant that I purposely landed in each new locations not knowing anything about religious beliefs, language and social norms. It worked in my favor up until I arrived in Kuala Lumpur. On my first day in the country, I had planned to follow my typical plan and visit the national and art museums to learn about Malaysian culture. Unfortunately, I arrived during yellow and red shirt protests. All local attractions were closed and I ended up smack in  a protest. While I am sure I was never in any real danger, being stuck in the middle of a screaming and upset group of people was scary. I took refuge in a nearby mall and ended up being stranded there for 4 hours. No taxis or Ubers wanted to come to my location due to road closures and fears of property damages. With each hour, I got more and more scared and worried. When I was finally able to get to my hotel, I made arrangements to leave the day after to go to Cambodia. I am hoping to go back to KL and get a chance to see all the city has to offer.</p>

<p>After my failure in Malaysia, I landed in Siem Reap defeated. Cambodia was breathtaking. It was the first time that I saw real poverty and luxury in the same location. It was in Siem Reap that I realized how small my problems really were. I saw and talked to people struggling to afford day to day life and here I was suffering from a broken heart. Siem Reap helped me refocus and gave me a different perspective. It wasn&rsquo;t about what my problems were but how I approached them. I was not as powerless as I thought I was. I could make the choice to not let my situations impact me and move forward. There, I met some of the most life-loving individuals. As we were exchanging travel stories and tips, we all realized that we were into the same type of music. One of the members of the group ran to his hotel room and brought back his turntables. We had an impromptu dance party in the middle of Siem Reap. I sang and danced my heart away to familiar songs in a an unfamiliar land with unfamiliar people. At that time, I realized that I was happy. For the first time in months, there were no hidden emotions behind my smile, it was pure happiness and I never wanted it to end.</p>

<p>I went to Angkor Wat at sunrise and felt lost and transported to a different world visiting all the cultural sites of the country. The Tuol Seng prison and the lives lost there forced me to put my life into perspective. I realized the following facts that I knew deep down but up until then was unwilling to accept: 1) I was getting divorced, 2) I was deeply hurt that I wasn&rsquo;t enough for my husband , 3) I still loved Carl and needed to respect his choice, 4) This was not the end for me. Weirdly, coming to these realizations made me calmer. I knew what I had to do. I had to use the remaining days of this trip to try to discover as much as I could about myself.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/friends-trip-skyline.jpg" title="Sunrise at Angkor Wat, Siem Reap." ></p>

<p>Along with self discovery and adventure-filled days came the not-so fun ones. Thanksgiving day landed while I was in Phnom Penh. As an immigrant, Thanksgiving meant spending time with Carl&rsquo;s family. Up until Thanksgiving day, I thought about Carl during my trip but never more than &ldquo;Carl would have loved eating this, or visiting this area or enjoyed talking with this individual&rdquo;. But as I was staring at my plate of mashed potatoes and turkey, I not only felt a overwhelming sense of loss but also felt shame. Only a few hours prior, I was reveling in the country&rsquo;s history and congratulating myself in having a fresh new perspective on life. I could not finish my plate and walked back to my hotel room beaten. For the first time since I started on this adventure, I was happy that I was traveling alone. I spent the rest of my day watching TV locked in my hotel room.</p>

<p>After 3 weeks on the road, I headed back to Vietnam for my last week abroad. For convenience, I reserved a room in the same hotel I had checked at the beginning of this trip. I suddenly realized that the person who checked in 3 weeks ago was not the person who was walking in. I couldn&rsquo;t put my finger on what it was specifically but I felt more confident and more at peace with myself. A former coworker traveling in Ho Chi Minh City at the same time reached out and we connected for dinner. His first words to me were &ldquo;&hellip; so, what is going on, where is your husband?&rdquo; We hadn&rsquo;t seen each other for 4 years and apparently, my social media accounts had become a &ldquo;Eat, Pray, Love&rdquo; tribute. I explained my current situation, no longer ashamed of the fact that I had a failed marriage, and we traded travel stories. He had not left his hotel room until our meeting because he was overwhelmed by the city, especially the traffic. I can&rsquo;t put into words how satisfying it was for me to be able to teach him how to cross the road. I fondly remembered my old self, seating defeated in front of a bowl of pho. I couldn&rsquo;t have engineered a better end to 4 wonderful weeks in paradise.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/friends-trip-boat.jpg" title="On the way to floating market in Can Tho, Vietnam." ></p>

<p>Of course I glanced over many more experiences, people and locations visited. It would take days to write it all. I came back to the US on a high that I knew would not last but I was determined to keep it as long as possible. I had felt true happiness and connected with new people for the first time in 7 months. I was accepted even after I showed my true, deeply flawed self, but most importantly, I met myself. I discovered the foundations of who I was, what made me smile, happy and tick. I realized that I could survive, not just survive, I could thrive in a foreign environment and to commemorate it, I tattooed “Thrive” on my shoulder to always remind myself of that feeling. Told you that word was going to come back.</p>

    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/prius-adventures-a-year-later</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s time to write more about my adventures. I&rsquo;ve been traveling and living in my car for nearly a year now, mostly full-time (excluding hotels on infrequent business trips, occasional friends&#8217; couches, or AirBnB a few times I was sick or wanted a home). I&rsquo;d love to share what I&rsquo;ve learned over the past year.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/camping-in-california.jpg" title="Camping in California." ></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how a typical conversation with someone who just learned I&rsquo;m living in my car goes:</p>

<h2>You live in <em>that?</em></h2>

<p>Yes I do. I think I need to start from the beginning.</p>

<p>About a year ago I wasn&rsquo;t in a very good place emotionally. I&rsquo;ve been going through a divorce, my dream company declined my job application (spoiler: I got the job this year, yay), and my landlord decided that 12 tiny houses on a property isn&rsquo;t enough and it&rsquo;s time to kick everyone out to build a more dense apartment complex. I didn&rsquo;t do much outside of going to work and sleeping.</p>

<p>I think I saw an opportunity to do something drastic with my life, and I decided to take a leap of faith. I gave away everything I couldn&rsquo;t fit in the back of the car, and set on a road trip across continental United States (after spending a month doing test drives and adjusting my setup dozens of times).</p>

<p>The experience turned out to be more enjoyable than having a house.</p>

<h2>How do you even fit in there?!</h2>

<p>Everyone I talk to thinks the space is really cramped up, and I have to sleep curled into a ball in the trunk (or something along those lines).</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/feet-under-blanket.jpg" title="Pictures make it look really cramped up, but it's rather spacious inside." ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m 5&#8217;11&#8221;, and I have a flat twin-width bed in that&rsquo;s around 7 feet long (it&rsquo;s been awhile since I measured). I sleep on an inflatable pad wrapped in a sleeping bag, on top of another sleeping bag all wrapped in a silk sleeping bag cover - my composite mattress is about 3 inches thick. I use regular blankets and pillows, adding or removing a few depending on the temperature outside.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most comfortable beds I&rsquo;ve ever slept on.</p>

<h2>Poor soul, want to crash on my couch?</h2>

<p>This is an offer I get as soon as somebody learns I&rsquo;m living in a car (it&rsquo;s right up there with &ldquo;You must be saving so much money not paying rent!&rdquo;). Most people are really nice, and offer a place to stay. I think it stems from an understandable notion that one probably would only live in a car because of being in a bad situation.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/inside-of-the-car-view-from-the-back.jpg" title="View of the bed from the back of the car." ></p>

<p>Oddly enough I really enjoy the lifestyle, and I always reject the offers (always appreciate them though). Sometimes I contemplate getting a small RV or a van, but I&rsquo;m way to attached to air conditioning on demand and 50 mpg on the highway. But I probably won&rsquo;t need to crash on your couch.</p>

<p>I think the TL;DR here is that majority of people are really nice, once you get out and get to interact with them enough.</p>

<h2>Why on Earth are you still living in a car?</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s more than one reason at this point. Part of it is that it has become a habit now. The biggest reason is probably all the fun things it has forced me to do.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve met a lot of cool people, tried out so many things I would&rsquo;ve never considered trying, and found exciting hobbies I would&rsquo;ve never had otherwise. I&rsquo;m also now in a great shape physically since I usually have to hit up the gym to shower.</p>

<p>It also made me confront my inner demons, since car living tends to consistently provide me with time to be alone with my thoughts - be it driving somewhere, or falling asleep in an area where I wouldn&rsquo;t want to use electronics. I feel more in tune with myself, and I can close my eyes without being afraid of stream of thoughts keeping me awake at night.</p>

<h2>That&rsquo;s cool! What else is inside?</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/before-and-after-bike-rack.jpg" title="Bike rack: before and after." ></p>

<h3>The front</h3>

<p>I try to keep driver&rsquo;s seat and front passenger seat area clean and empty, with storing some low key items in passenger seat leg space &ndash; portable 12V vacuum, water jug, water boiler/thermos.</p>

<p>The front seats are separated from the back by a dark curtain. Unless you shine a (powerful) flashlight inside a car it&rsquo;s almost impossible to tell the curtain is there.</p>

<h3>The back</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/window-cutout-from-the-inside.jpg" title="In addition to curtains I also have custom-made window cutouts." ></p>

<p>One of the passenger seats is lowered to make a bed. The bed is extended with a wooden panel specifically made for this purpose which creates a flat surface about 7 foot long. A mattress with a blanket and some throws creates /a nice homey look.</p>

<p>Under the bed is &ldquo;the basement&rdquo; &ndash; large clear container where I store winter clothes and things I rarely use. If I&rsquo;m camping extra water jugs go here as well. And some bicycle maintenance stuff, and extra pairs of shoes.</p>

<p>I use the other rear passenger seat as my primary relaxing area when I&rsquo;m inside the car. There&rsquo;s a little trashcan stuck to the floor in between the seats.</p>

<h3>Cargo and the bike</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s an old suitcase I use for organizing various cooking and camping supplies. It&rsquo;s split into nine compartments by some separators I&rsquo;ve put together. This is where I have some freeze dried veggies, spices, grains and pasta, cooking oils, camping pots and pans, equipment for cleaning the dishes, etc. On top of the suitcase is a backpack where I keep clothes. There&rsquo;s also a propane burner, camping table and a chair, as well as a toiletry kit. Dirty laundry goes in a dry bag.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/cooking-supplies-in-the-suitcase.jpg" title="Cooking supplies in a suitcase." ></p>

<p>I also have a bike strapped to the outside of the car, exploring places by bike after arriving to a new city is very rewarding!</p>

<h2>Isn&rsquo;t it dangerous?</h2>

<p>You often read stories of people suffocating in their own cars, and it&rsquo;s something to be aware of. There are a few rules I follow to be safe, and there are three main dangers here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Carbon monoxide poisoning.</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide poisoning.</li>
<li>Extreme temperatures.</li>
</ol>


<p>I sleep with carbon monoxide alarm not far from my head, and my car is a hybrid &ndash; meaning it only turns itself on once in a while when batteries need to be recharged. Sometimes I sleep with my car on, and sometimes not. The alarm never went off so far (it works, I check regularly).</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (stuff you exhale) poisoning is not a silent killer (unlike carbon monoxide), humans are pretty good at detecting high concentration of CO2 &ndash; panic attack on par with a headache are a rather clear sign of this happening. I keep windows cracked open most of the time, plus my AC is often on.</p>

<p>I love sleeping at low temperatures (50-60F is my comfort zone for snuggling up under a blanket), but if local forecast suggests the temperature will drop below 50F at night - I make sure to sleep with AC on. If it&rsquo;s below freezing - I roll up the windows, otherwise I still keep them cracked open a little.</p>

<p>And if it&rsquo;s really cold and I don&rsquo;t want to run AC all night, or I just feel like I want to stay inside for a bit - I can just get AirBnB for a couple of nights. Speaking of, by pure chance I stayed at Gayle Laakmann McDowell&rsquo;s guest house few weeks ago, and I left with great memories and a signed copy of Cracking the Code Interview. Bonus point for meeting cool people.</p>

<h2>How does Prius AC work anyway?</h2>

<p>This question pops up often enough to address here (along with condensation concerns from seasoned vandwellers).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a hybrid with two electric motors assisting the internal combustion engine. The electric motors power up from a ~1.3 kWh battery, which is recharged using the engine and regenerative brakes. That battery is connected to the 12V battery, and as long as there&rsquo;s gas in the car &ndash; both batteries will be charged. In practice, if the car isn&rsquo;t moving, engine turns on every half an hour or so for a little under a minute to recharge the batteries.</p>

<p>This allows one to keep the car on and use the AC throughout the night. AC also keeps the moisture level at bay, preventing condensation. I also noticed that when I don&rsquo;t use the AC cracked windows help with condensation (I have rain guards for stealth and keeping the rain out).</p>

<h2>Um, how do you do bathroom stuff?</h2>

<p>If we&rsquo;re talking about changing - there&rsquo;s plenty of space in the back of the car to change.</p>

<p>For hygiene - I use gym showers (I take quite a lot of classes), or wet wipes if I&rsquo;m out camping or shower is otherwise unavailable. I&rsquo;m now kind of an expert on all sorts of wipes. Any restroom works for brushing my teeth at night, and in US it&rsquo;s very difficult not to be within the vicinity of a public bathroom.</p>

<h2>Where do you park at night?</h2>

<p>Rest stops are the best when I travel, since everyone on a rest stop is just resting/sleeping in their car.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-lit-up-at-night.jpg" title="Christmas lights make inside more homey." ></p>

<p>There are so many places to park: since this is just a passenger car, anywhere where cars can park is good. Usually somewhere with either a lot of foot traffic (or the exact opposite). Parking lots of 24/7 business, residential areas, anywhere and anytime.</p>

<h2>What do your friends and coworkers say?</h2>

<p>Most colleagues and acquaintances don&rsquo;t know, since it&rsquo;s not really a topic that pops up during a normal conversation. I go to work and social events well groomed, with clean clothes, and (I&rsquo;d like to think) demonstrating a sense of style.</p>

<p>Few friends and colleagues that do know that I live in the car don&rsquo;t see it as anything out of the ordinary (past the initial shock of course). I can&rsquo;t remember the last time conversation got stirred towards car living with any of my close friends. A few are rather jealous but reluctant to make the move. I try not to preach.</p>

<p>My love life surprisingly didn&rsquo;t suffer. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I tend to pursue women just as odd as me, but me living in a car didn&rsquo;t have any negative effects, and even got me a date or two. If someone doesn&rsquo;t want to go out with you because of living arrangements - they would probably not make a good partner in a long run.</p>

<h2>Do strangers bother you?</h2>

<p>When you observe people you start noticing how much everyone&rsquo;s concerned with what people think of them. In fact, most people so concerned with themselves - that they don&rsquo;t look around. Encounters with people who notice I live in a car are nearly non-existent. Nobody cares to look inside one of the hundred cars in a parking lot or parked on the side of the street.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a few rather friendly encounters with parking lot security, with people usually just demonstrating concern. Until I share my setup that is, then concern is often replacement with mild jealousy.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/making-a-meal-at-a-rest-stop.jpg" title="I sometimes make meals at rest stops." ></p>

<p>Most encounters with strangers approaching me happen at rest stops, since I usually don&rsquo;t hide much &ndash; there are enough misfits and travelers. Every encounter like that I&rsquo;ve had was positive, with people commenting on how amazing my setup is, how they wished they could do a similar thing, or sharing a story about their own travels.</p>

<h2>How do you not go crazy?</h2>

<p>This is where the fun part starts. You see, the thing about living in the car is how boring it is. There&rsquo;s really not much you can do in a confined space. So I have to get out of my way to entertain myself.</p>

<p>I take a lot of classes like various martial arts or archery. I tried miniature painting, rock climbing, long distance cycling. There are numerous things I&rsquo;m &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to do in order to keep myself entertained.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things I do inside the car too. Writing or coding (even though I prefer coffee shops), rare indulgence in video games (I recently picked up a gaming laptop for this), guitalele (it&rsquo;s a ukulele-sized guitar), reading. Drawing, keeping a journal, or just relaxing.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/laptop-hooked-up-to-the-headrest.jpg" title="I setup laptop at an eye level and use external keyboard." ></p>

<p>And of course there are people. When I travel I end up meeting a lot of different people. I often get invited to join somebody at a campsite, and we&rsquo;d cook a meal together or share some stories. Or somebody sitting next to me in a coffee shop works in the same industry and we grab lunch to mingle and share interesting ideas. Wherever I go I get lucky enough to make friends for a couple of minutes, hours, days, and sometimes months.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next for you?</h2>

<p>For now, I&rsquo;m used to living in a car. I sometimes pop by AirBnBs or friends&#8217; places for a couple of days, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say I enjoy being tied down to a single location for a long period of time.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/cycling-by-the-ocean.jpg" title="Cycling on the West Coast is the best." ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m contemplating getting an RV to be able to stand up inside and have more room and privacy, but potential difficulties with air conditioning at night, atrocious gas mileage, and inefficient and noisy generators for my power usage are a concern of mine.</p>

<p>Once in a while I contemplate getting myself an apartment. Since it&rsquo;s now winter I end up staying in AirBnBs more often, but I feel like having a place to call home makes it harder for me to a fight a lazy person inside me. I like when that person is forced to learn, explore, and create.</p>

    <updated>2016-10-09T21:24:26+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/hackmud-first-impressions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My Saturday just disappeared, quickly, and barely with any trace. You could find
leftover scripts all over my hard drive here and there, all pointing to Hackmud.
One moment I had plans for the day, and the next it was well past midnight, I
was listening to the 90s hacker movies inspired soundtrack while cracking locks
and farming for credits with a script I crafted.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent ten hours in game, and it was glorious.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/hackmud-startup-logo.png" title="Hackmud startup logo." ></p>

<p>Hackmud is a text-only MUD (multi-user dungeon) set in a not so distant future,
where humanity was wiped out by a combination of Welsh Measels, killer rabbit
outbreak, and multiple other disasters. All that&rsquo;s left is a trace of old
corporations, dead user accounts, and AIs roaming the net. That&rsquo;s you, an AI.</p>

<p>Game has a heavy 90s vibe to it, and the atmosphere reminds me of Ready Player
One. References to popular TV shows and dial up sounds included.</p>

<p>You start in a training area, a vLAN without access to the rest of the network
and other players. You quickly learn all-text interface, and simple bash-like
command line - it&rsquo;s based on JavaScript, with a few syntax changes. Hackmud is
very much a puzzle game, and lets you take your time with a tutorial: you&rsquo;ll
need a few hours to go through all the puzzles, cracking locks, installing
upgrades, learning about security, and finally - escaping vLAN.</p>

<p>Here are some basics I picked up:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can have multiple user accounts within a game, and so can everyone else.
Be on the lookout.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Locs&rdquo; are account locations, something similar to an IP or a domain name. You
can launch an attack against a user or a dead account if you know their loc.</li>
<li>Scripts are just that - scripts written in JavaScript (outside of the game).
Hit <code>#help</code> and Google to get started, but at least some basic programming
background is necessary here.</li>
<li>Locks protect accounts - one can be behind multiple locks. Lock usually
requires you to guess the correct combination, like a color, correct lower
order prime, or a keyword.</li>
<li>Upgrades are installed on user accounts and include locks, script
slots, character limits, etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>At some point I successfully struggled through the tutorial and escaped vLAN.
And that&rsquo;s where the open-ended social nature of the game shines. You&rsquo;re thrown
into a global chat channel with users trying to trick you into running their
malware, players and corporations providing banking services, selling breached
account information, locks, and scripts.</p>

<p>The game encourages lying, betrayal, deception, ponzi schemes, money laundering
- you name it. And players take advantage of such freedoms to the full extent:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/hackmud-window-screenshot.png" title="This is how the Hackmud gameplay looks.." ></p>

<p>It looks rather confusing, but tutorial prepares you well for the chaotic flow
of characters on the screen.</p>

<p>I really wasn&rsquo;t sure what to do next. The tutorial taught me how to get money
out of dead accounts, so I decided to try to find one or two. After asking about
in the main channel and being offered a few dozen &ldquo;risk free scripts to get locs
worth millions&rdquo;, I decided to set out on a search. I looked through a list of
<code>scripts.fullsec</code>, and found a few corporations.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/hackmud-corporations-screenshot.png" title="Two Hackmud corporations - Macrosoft and Core." ></p>

<p>After digging about in their files for a good few hours, I found a way to get to
employee registry and get a dozen of dead user locs. The locs were protected by
different kinds of locks, and I went through the first batch manually. It took
me a long time to get all the combinations and pull out some cash out of the
accounts.</p>

<p>I found my second batch of locs shortly after, and decided to try automating
some manual attempts through scripting. After struggling with syntax and being
aggravated by having only 120 seconds at a time to crack a lock (in line with
the 90s feel of the game, one needs to be connected to a &ldquo;hardline&rdquo;), I wrote a
first sample script, and started to play around with game concepts.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/hackmud-hardline-dial.png" title="Hardline dial screenshot." ></p>

<p>Hackmud is in no way an accurate hacking simulator, but it&rsquo;s a really fun puzzle
game, and it doesn&rsquo;t make any outrageous mistakes. It allows you to write your
own scripts to use in game using valid JavaScript with access to a game library.
Game developer (it&rsquo;s a one person project) implemented his own JavaScript
interpreter, so it has bugs here and there - one should be careful using obscure
language features.</p>

<p>The worst part about scripting was character limitations: one needs quite a bit
of money to be able to install first upgrades, and default limit of one active
script and 500 characters per script is straight-up rage inducing. Before
getting my first 1MGC to finally upgrade my rig, I wrote a bunch of tiny
scripts, one per lock type, struggling to keep to the character limit. I ended
up with ugly monstrosities like this, manually passing results from one script
to another when encountering multiple accounts:</p>

<pre><code>function(o, g) {
  var
    a = {},
    b = "ez_35",
    c = ["open", "release", "unlock"],
    d = "digit",
    r = "",
    s = false,
    t = g.target.call;

  for (var x in g) {
    if (x != "target") {
      a[x] = g[x];
    }
  }

  for (var i = 0; i &lt; c.length; i++) {
    a[b] = c[i];
    r = t(a);
    if (r.indexOf(d) &gt; -1) {
      for (var k = 0; k &lt; 10; k++) {
        a[d] = k
        r = t(a);
        if (r.indexOf(d) == -1) {
          var m = b + ":\"" + a[b] + "\", " + d + ": \"" + a[d] + "\"";
          return { ok:true, msg:r + "\n\n" + m };
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return { ok:s, msg:r };
}
</code></pre>

<p>It was really interesting working with the limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li>I couldn&rsquo;t write scripts longer than 500 characters (spaces not included).</li>
<li>I couldn&rsquo;t have access to one script without unloading the other first.</li>
<li>I had to debug and test the scripts within 120 second windows.</li>
</ul>


<p>Few more batches of locs later, I was finally able to afford to initialize my
system to tier 1 and install upgrades I bought and accumulated from hacking
accounts:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/hackmud-upgrades-screenshot.png" title="Installed upgrades." ></p>

<p>Now I can write all the scripts I want! Excited, I built my first t1 (tier 1)
lock breaker, which automatically cracks a loc with any number of t1 locks on
it:</p>

<pre><code>function(context, func_args) { // {target:"#s."}

  var digits = Array();
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    digits.push(i);
  }

  var
    COLORS = [
      "purple", "blue", "cyan", "green", "lime", "yellow", "orange", "red"],
    DIGITS = digits,
    LOCKS = ["open", "release", "unlock"],
    // ez_prime lock seems to only request low order primes, hardcoding this
    PRIMES = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59,
      61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137,
      139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193];

  var hackMultLevels = function(target, args, levels) {
    for (var i = 0; i &lt; levels.length; i++) {
      var
        item = levels[i].item,
        itemDesc = levels[i].itemDesc,
        itemList = levels[i].itemList;
      for (var k = 0; k &lt; itemList.length; k++) {
        args[item] = itemList[k];
        ret = target(args);
        if (ret.indexOf(itemDesc) == -1) {
          break;
        }
      }
    }
    return ret, args;
  }

  var hackEz21 = function(target, args) {
    return hackMultLevels(
      target,
      args,
      [
        { item: "ez_21", itemDesc: "command", itemList: LOCKS }
      ]);
  };

  var hackEz35 = function(target, args) {
    return hackMultLevels(
      target,
      args,
      [
        { item: "ez_35", itemDesc: "command", itemList: LOCKS },
        { item: "digit", itemDesc: "digit", itemList: DIGITS }
      ]);
  };

  var hackEz40 = function(target, args) {
    return hackMultLevels(
      target,
      args,
      [
        { item: "ez_40", itemDesc: "command", itemList: LOCKS },
        { item: "ez_prime", itemDesc: "prime", itemList: PRIMES }
      ]);
  };

  var hackC001 = function(target, args) {
    return hackMultLevels(
      target,
      args,
      [
        { item: "c001", itemDesc: "correct", itemList: COLORS },
        { item: "color_digit", itemDesc: "digit", itemList: DIGITS }
      ]);
  }

  var hackC002 = function(target, args) {
    return hackMultLevels(
      target,
      args,
      [
        { item: "c002", itemDesc: "correct", itemList: COLORS },

        { item: "c003_triad_2", itemDesc: "second", itemList: COLORS }
      ]);
  }

  var
    args = {},
    i = 0,
    locks = [
      { name: "EZ_21", func: hackEz21 },
      { name: "EZ_35", func: hackEz35 },

    unlocked = [];

  ret = target(args);

  while (true) {

      return { ok: true, msg: ret };
    }

    if (i &gt; 10) {
      return { ok: false, msg: ret }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Rather rough around the edges, not easiest to read, but it works - and I was
really proud of finishing it (and too tired to go back and refactor). With this,
next dozen of t1 locs took me a few minutes to crack open. Success!</p>

<p>That was the logical conclusion of my Saturday, and left me feel really
satisfied. The game is rough around the edges, and has numerous bugs here and
there. But the text-only world of Hackmud is alive and atmospheric, and puzzles
and exploration of the derelict world through randomly-generated documents pulls
you in, making you lose track of time.</p>

    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/a-year-with-pebble-time-round/"/>
    <updated>2016-10-05T18:12:59+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/a-year-with-pebble-time-round</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Disclaimer: This post was <strong>not</strong> endorsed by Pebble, nor I am affiliated with
Pebble.</em></p>

<p>About a year ago I&rsquo;ve tried out almost all wearables Pebble had to offer at a
time - the original, Pebble Time, and my favorite - Pebble Time Round. I
wouldn&rsquo;t call myself a fanboy, but Pebble watches are pretty damn great.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/pebble-time-round.jpg" title="Pebble Time Round watch on a wrist." ></p>

<p>Back then I was on a market for a smartwatch - something stylish, inexpensive,
and durable, to show time and notifications. After some research I immediately
ruled out all other wearables on the market: some were too much centered around
fitness (not my market), and some tried to put a computer with a tiny screen on
your hand (I&rsquo;m looking at you, Apple and Google). I wasn&rsquo;t interested in either,
and I was charmed with simplicity of Pebble.</p>

<p>First, I&rsquo;ve gotten <a href="http://amzn.to/2dTaEoR">the original Pebble</a>. I was blown away by the battery
life which neared two weeks, beautiful minimalist design, and the absence of
touch screen. The last one is probably the main reason why I&rsquo;m still using
Pebble.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a watch, it has a tiny screen the size of my thumb. How am I supposed to
control it with gestures with 100% accuracy? Unlike with a phone, I interact
with my watch often during more demanding activities - cycling, running, gym,
meeting, etc. Having physical buttons doesn&rsquo;t require me to look at a screen as
I perform an action (quick glance to read a notification is enough - I can reply
or dismiss without having to look at the watch again).</p>

<p>After using the original pebble for a few weeks I was curious to try out <a href="http://amzn.to/2e38eXO">Pebble
Time</a>. I enjoyed having colorful display, the battery life was almost as
long, and the watch felt smaller than the original one. It was a decent choice,
but still couldn&rsquo;t help but feel like a square digital watch doesn&rsquo;t fit my
style.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when I decided to try out <a href="http://amzn.to/2dfCN8B">Pebble Time Round</a>. It&rsquo;s the smallest of
the three, and definitely one of the thinnest smartwatches available (at only
7.5 mm). I went for a silver model with a 14 mm strap. Initially there was a
lack of affordable straps, but after some time <a href="https://www.gadgetwraps.com/">GadgetWraps</a> filled in that
niche.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a year now, and it&rsquo;s still going strong. Pebble Time Round (or PTR as
people call it) doesn&rsquo;t have the longest battery life, averaging at about 2 days
until hitting the low power mode (when Pebble watches run low on juice they only
display time). I usually charge it daily, since charging 56 mAh battery doesn&rsquo;t
take long (it gets a full day of use from 15 a minute charge).</p>

<p>PTR is much more a watch than anything else: it looks good, and it shows time.
All the necessary things are available at a glance - calendar, notifications,
texts, weather, music controls, timers and alarms. I use voice dictation to send
out an occasional text.</p>

<p>I work in a corporate setting, with sometimes difficult to manage number of
meetings, constant Hangouts pings, and a stream of emails. Pebble helps me
easily navigate hectic daily routine without having to pull up my phone or my
laptop to look up the next conference room, meeting attendees, or reply to a
quick ping.</p>

<p>Due to app marketplace similar to Google Play Store (with most if not all the
apps and watchfaces free) I find it easy to customize Pebble based on a
situation I&rsquo;m in. I&rsquo;m traveling and need to be able to pull up my flight?
Check. Need to call an Uber from my wrist? Check. Get walking directions? Check.</p>

<p>To my delight Pebble as a platform is rather close to Linux ideology. Pebble
apps are modular and tend to focus on one thing and do one thing well.</p>

<p>Recently a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-2-time-2-and-core-an-entirely-new-3g-ultra">Kickstarter for Pebble 2</a> has been announced. It&rsquo;s rather
unfortunate PTR is not getting an updated version, but to be honest it doesn&rsquo;t
really need to. It&rsquo;s a fantastic combination of hardware and software which
fills in a specific niche: a stylish smartwatch for displaying relevant chunks
of information.</p>

    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/mob-level-distribution/"/>
    <updated>2016-10-02T00:15:12+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/mob-level-distribution</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Distributing mobs in a dungeon based on player&rsquo;s level (or some dungeon level
difficulty factor) was somewhat straightforward, but I would still like to
document the progress. I needed to place a mob that&rsquo;s somewhat within the
difficulty level I want, plus minus a few difficulty levels to spice it up.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/roguelike-leveled-mob-distribution.png" title="Random mob distribution in roguelike dungeon." ></p>

<p>Above you can see three rats, three cats, a dog (<code>r</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>d</code>, all level 1), a
farmer (<code>f</code>, level 2), and a lonely bandit (<code>b</code>, level 3) in a level 1 dungeon.</p>

<p>Without going straight into measure theory, I generated intervals for each mob
based on the diff of desired level and their level, and then randomly selected a
point within the boundaries. Here&rsquo;s the abstract code:</p>

<pre><code>import bisect
import random


def get_random_element(data, target, chance):
    """Get random element from data set skewing towards target.

    Args:
        data   -- A dictionary with keys as elements and values as weights.
                  Duplicates are allowed.
        target -- Target weight, results will be skewed towards target
                  weight.
        chance -- A float 0..1, a factor by which chance of picking adjacent
                  elements decreases (i.e, with chance 0 we will always
                  select target element, with chance 0.5 probability of
                  selecting elements adjacent to target are halved with each
                  step).

    Returns:
        A random key from data with distribution respective of the target
        weight.
    """
    intervals = []  # We insert in order, no overlaps.
    next_i = 0
    for element, v in data.iteritems():
        d = max(target, v) - min(target, v)
        size = 100
        while d &gt; 0:  # Decrease chunk size for each step of `d`.
            size *= chance
            d -= 1
        if size == 0:
            continue
        size = int(size)
        intervals.append((next_i, next_i + size, element))
        next_i += size + 1
    fst, _, _ = zip(*intervals)
    rnd = random.randint(0, next_i - 1)
    idx = bisect.bisect(fst, rnd)  # This part is O(log n).
    return intervals[idx - 1][2]
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if I test the above for, say, a 1000000 iterations, with a chance of 0.5
(halving probability of selecting adjacent elements with each step), and 2 as a
target, here&rsquo;s the distribution I end up with:</p>

<pre><code>target, chance, iterations = 2, 0.5, 1000000

data = collections.OrderedDict([  # Ordered to make histogram prettier.
    ('A', 0), ('B-0', 1), ('B-1', 1), ('C', 2), ('D', 3), ('E', 4),
    ('F', 5), ('G', 6), ('H', 7), ('I', 8), ('J', 9),
])

res = collections.OrderedDict([(k, 0) for k, _ in data.iteritems()])

# This is just a test, so there's no need to optimize this for now.
for _ in xrange(iterations):
    res[get_random_element(data, target, chance)] += 1

pyplot.bar(
    range(len(res)), res.values(), width=0.7, align='center', color='green')
pyplot.xticks(range(len(res)), res.keys())
pyplot.title(
    'iterations={}, target={}, chance={}'.format(
        iterations, target, chance))

<p>You can see elements B-0 and B-1 having roughly the same distribution, since
they have the same weight.</p>

<p>Now, if I decrease the <code>chance</code>, likelihood of target being selected increases,
while likelihood of surrounding elements being selected decreases:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/roguelike-mob-distribution-chance-033.png" title="Distribution histogram: 1000000 iterations, 0.33 chance, and 2 as a target." ></p>

<p>I works the opposite way as well, increasing the <code>chance</code> decreases likelihood
of the target being selected and increases the probability for surrounding
elements.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/roguelike-mob-distribution-chance-09.png" title="Distribution histogram: 1000000 iterations, 0.9 chance, and 2 as a target." ></p>

<p>For the sake of completeness, it works with 0 chance of surrounding elements being picked:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/roguelike-mob-distribution-chance-0.png" title="Distribution histogram: 1000000 iterations, 0 chance, and 2 as a target." ></p>

<p>And an equal chance of picking surrounding elements:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/roguelike-mob-distribution-chance-1.png" title="Distribution histogram: 1000000 iterations, 1 chance, and 2 as a target." ></p>

<p>After playing around with the configuration in Jupyter Notebook, I cleaned up
the algorithm above and included it into mob placement routine.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After generating a few <a href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/randomly-generated-dungeons/">good looking random dungeons</a>, I was puzzled with
randomly placing mobs on resulting maps. To make it fair (and fun) for the
player mobs should be evenly distributed.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/dungeon-mob-placement.png" title="Dungeon with randomly placed mobs." ></p>

<p>The obvious idea was to pick coordinates randomly within the rectangular map
boundaries, and then place mobs if they have floor underneath them. But this way
I lose control of the number of mobs and risk having a chance of not placing any
mobs at all. Plus, dungeons with bigger surface area would get more mobs - which
sounds somewhat realistic, but not entirely what I was aiming for.</p>

<p>I could improve on the above by rerunning enemy placement multiple times and
select the most favorable outcome - but the solution would be rather naive.</p>

<p>To have control over the number of mobs I decided to place them as I generate
the rooms of the dungeon. There&rsquo;s a trick one can use to get a random element
with equal probability distribution from a sequence of an unknown size:</p>

<pre><code>import random


def get_random_element(sequence):
    """Select a random element from a sequence of an unknown size."""
    selected = None
    for k, element in enumerate(sequence):
        if random.randint(0, k) == 0:
            selected = element
    return selected
</code></pre>

<p>With each iteration the chance of the current element to become a selected item
is 1 divided by number of elements seen so far. Indeed, a probability of an
element being selected out of a 4-item sequence:</p>

<pre><code>1 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/4) = 1/2 * 2/3 * 3/4 = 6/30 = 1/4 
</code></pre>

<p>Now all I had to do is to modify this to account for multiple mob placement.
Here&rsquo;s a generalized function above which accounts for selecting <code>n</code> elements
from the sequence with even distribution.</p>

<pre><code>import random


def get_random_element(sequence, n):
    """Select n random elements from a sequence of an unknown size."""
    selected = [None for _ in range(n)]
    for k, element in enumerate(sequence):
        for i in range(n):
            if random.randint(0, k) == 0:
                selected[i] = element
    return selected
</code></pre>

<p>I incorporated logic above into the room generation code, accounted for
duplicates, and ended up with decent distribution results.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After playing with random dungeon generation for a bit, I seem to be satisfied
with the results:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/random-dungeon-1.png" title="A randomly generated ASCII-dungeon." ></p>

<p>The above is displayed using ADOM notation - <code>#</code> represents a wall, <code>.</code> is a
floor tile, and <code>+</code> is meant to be a closed door. After fiddling about with a
few random dungeon generation ideas, I settled with the following.</p>

<h2>The algorithm</h2>

<ol>
<li>Start with a random point on a canvas.</li>
<li>Create a room with random width and height. Don&rsquo;t worry about walls yet.</li>
<li>Select a few points on the sides of the room, put those in a stack. Save the
direction in which the potential doors would point.</li>
<li>Go through the stack, and try to add a room or a corridor (corridor is just a
room with a width or a height of 1). Higher chance of corridors seems to look
better and results in those wiggly passageways.

<ol>
<li>Try to add a room a few dozen times with different random configurations.
If no luck - give up and grab a new item from the stack. If couldn&rsquo;t
generate a continuation to the corridor - mark it as a loose end, we&rsquo;ll
clean those up later.</li>
<li>If a room was added successfully - add a door where it connects to the
previous room/corridor. Add a floor section if it&rsquo;s a corridor connecting
to another corridor.</li>
<li>At this point one ends up with quite a few interconnected corridors,
merged rooms, and all kinds of fun surroundings (my desired goal).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Do the above until the stack is empty or a desired number of rooms has been
generated.</li>
<li>Clean up the loose ends from step 4.1. Remove loose corridor segments one by
one until intersection with another room/corridor is detected.</li>
<li>Add walls around the rooms and corridors, while also cleaning up any extra
doors we may have left behind when creating merged corridors or rooms.

<ol>
<li>I simply used slightly modified depth first search starting inside any
room and drawing walls wherever I could find floor/door not connected to
anything.</li>
<li>When encountering a door - check if it&rsquo;s surrounded by walls or doors from
the opposite sides. If not - remove the door and replace it with a floor
tile. If any doors were adjucent to the removed door - requeue the door
check on them.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Perform steps 1-7 a few hundred times, saving the resulting dungeons each
time. Pick the best candidate with the most desired features - like a number
of rooms, breadth, square footage, longest corridors, etc.</li>
</ol>


<p>A more detailed explanation of the steps is below. For now, here are a few more
dungeons generated using this method:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/random-dungeon-2.png" title="A randomly generated ASCII-dungeon." ></p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/random-dungeon-3.png" title="A randomly generated ASCII-dungeon." ></p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/random-dungeon-4.png" title="A randomly generated ASCII-dungeon." ></p>

<p>I think dungeon generation is far more art than science, and I had a lot of fun
tweaking all the different input parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li>Room size boundaries.</li>
<li>Corridor lengths.</li>
<li>Frequency of corridor occurrences.</li>
<li>Number of exits from the room.</li>
<li>Number of room generation attempts.</li>
<li>Number of dungeon generation attempts.</li>
<li>Final dungeon picking heuristics.</li>
</ul>


<p>Last item on the list is the most interesting one - with few hundred dungeons as
an input, picking the right one is rather important. I ended up settling on
using max priority queue with a rough surface area of the dungeon as a key
(it&rsquo;s more of a breadth, really - how wide and tall it is). Then I&rsquo;d sift
through some top results and pick the one with the most rooms available. This
results in the most fun-looking map which feels up most of the screen, while
still usually not being too cluttered.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of a simple scenario:</p>

<h3>Steps 1 and 2</h3>

<p>Pick a random spot on a canvas and generate a room of random size (4 x 3):</p>

<pre><code>....
....
....
</code></pre>

<h3>Step 3</h3>

<p>Select potential spots for doors, let&rsquo;s label them 1, 2, 3.</p>

<pre><code>....2
....
....1
  3
</code></pre>

<p>I went for a uniform distribution by unfolding the rectangle and folding it back
in to get a proper coordinate on the perimeter. Now, stack contains coordinates
of <code>[1, 2, 3]</code> (along with the directions in which they are pointing).</p>

<h3>Steps 4 and 5</h3>

<p>Add a room or a corridor to a connector number 3. We&rsquo;ll be adding the room to
the right of number 3. Let&rsquo;s assume random sends a corridor of length 5 our way.
We&rsquo;re happy with the corridor pointing either up, down, or right - so we let the
random decide again: up.</p>

<pre><code>     4
     .
     .
....2.
.... .
....3.
  1
</code></pre>

<p>We add the end of the corridor to the stack as number 4 (now <code>[1, 2, 4]</code>). We
also mark 4 as a loose end, in case we end up not adding a room to it. Dangling
corridors are never pretty.</p>

<p>Now, to replace number 3 with a door:</p>

<pre><code>     4
     .
     .
....2.
.... .
....+.
  1
</code></pre>

<p>Adding another random corridor of length 2 to the point 4, pointing right.
Replace number 4 with a floor segment, since point 4 was the end of another
corridor. Remove point 4 from loose ends, add point 5.</p>

<pre><code>     ...5
     .
     .
....2.
.... .
....+.
  1
</code></pre>

<p>Take point 5, generate a room of size 3 x 6. 5 becomes a door. Loose ends list
is empty.</p>

<pre><code>     ...+...
     .   ...
     .   ...
....2.   ...
.... .   ...
....+.   ...
  1
</code></pre>

<p>For simplicity&rsquo;s sake, let&rsquo;s assume we don&rsquo;t want any more exits from this room.
Back to the stack of <code>[1, 2]</code>. Point 2 seem to not have much room for growth.
After a few unsuccessful attempts to place a room or a corridor there, we give
up:</p>

<pre><code>     ...+...
     .   ...
     .   ...
.... .   ...
.... .   ...
....+.   ...
  1
</code></pre>

<p>Now for point 1: we get another corridor of length 3. Point 6 is now added to
the loose ends list.</p>

<pre><code>     ...+...
     .   ...
     .   ...
.... .   ...
.... .   ...
....+.   ...
  +
  .
  .
  .
  6
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume we run out of space and can&rsquo;t add anything to the end of 6. We&rsquo;re
done generating the dungeon. Our stack is empty, and our loose ends contains
coordinates of <code>6</code>.</p>

<h3>Step 6</h3>

<p>Start with the loose end, and remove items one by one until a tile with multiple
neighbors is encountered:</p>

<pre><code>     ...+...
     .   ...
     .   ...
.... .   ...
.... .   ...
....+.   ...
  X
  X
  X
  X
  X
</code></pre>

<p>Viola:</p>

<pre><code>     ...+...
     .   ...
     .   ...
.... .   ...
.... .   ...
....+.   ...
</code></pre>

<h3>Steps 7 and 8</h3>

<p>There are no rogue doors in this scenario, so all we need to do is add  the
walls:</p>

<pre><code>     #########
     #...+...#
     #.###...#
######.# #...#
#....#.# #...#
#....#.# #...#
#....+.# #...#
######## #####
</code></pre>

<p>All of the steps above should be repeated a few hundred times with different
dungeons, and then the best dungeon should be picked as a final one.</p>

<p>Did I miss anything? Was cleaning up &ldquo;loose ends&rdquo; too much of a hack? What
should have I done differently?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Notes to make sure I don&rsquo;t forget how to do this in the future. First, install
<code>mssql</code> and <code>vcli</code> tools:</p>

<pre><code>npm install -g sql-cli
pip install vcli
</code></pre>

<p>Encrypt desired database account passwords:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/.passwd
echo '$PASSWORD' | gpg --use-agent -e &gt; ~/.passwd/$DB_ACCOUNT.gpg
</code></pre>

<p>Set up a set of aliases with the desired level of flexibility in <code>~/.bashrc</code> to
avoid typing too much:</p>

<pre><code>function _sql-helper-command {
  host=$1
  user=$2
  password=$3
  db=$4
  opt_query_file=$5

  if [ -z $opt_query_file ]; then
    mssql -s $host -u $user -p $password -d $db
  else
    mssql -s $host -u $user -p $password -d $db -q "`cat $opt_query_file`"
  fi
}

function _vsql-helper-command {
  host=$1
  user=$2
  password=$3

  vcli -h $host -U $user -w $password
}

# Usage: `sql` for interactive mode, `sql filename.sql` to execute a file.
function sql {
  opt_query_file=$1

  host='$SOME_HOST'
  user='$SOME_USER'
  password=`gpg --use-agent --quiet --batch -d ~/.passwd/$SOME_FILENAME.gpg`
  db='$SOME_DB'

  host=$1
  user=`whoami`

}
</code></pre>

<p>Replace <code>$SOME_USER</code>, <code>$SOME_HOST</code>, <code>$SOME_DB</code>, <code>$SOME_FILENAME</code> above with
specific user, host, DB, and filenames respectively. I usually make a bunch of
aliases for different environments/machines I use: <code>sql-prod</code>, <code>sql-dev</code>,
<code>sql-local</code> or <code>vsql-host1</code>, <code>vsql-host2</code>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I like traveling. I&rsquo;ve been living on the road on and off for the past half a year, traveling across the US. This whole time I live in my car, and quite frankly, I enjoy it.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/colorado-mountains.jpg" title="View of the highway leading to Colorado mountains.." ></p>

<p>Passing beautiful vistas and not having a place to call home are two sides of the same coin. It&rsquo;s something that gives me time to think.</p>

<p>From a very young age we surround ourselves with objects of comfort. It all starts with toys we have as children. First things we own. Our room. Friends. House. Job. Town. Country. We take comfort in certain parts of the environment. Be it objects, people, or places.</p>

<p>After getting rid of most of my belongings and starting my journey - I felt like a lot of things which made me feel comfortable and safe were gone. It made me feel very exposed to the world.</p>

<p>When objects of comfort are gone, one has to face a lot of their own demons. Issues hidden by a security blanket are let out to roam freely. Living on the road amplifies the experiences I have: the ups are high, and the downs are low. A wider specter of emotions is thrown onto me.</p>

<p>I guess there&rsquo;s a reason why majority of people all live in a similar manner. It&rsquo;s comforting. It&rsquo;s a void inside you that needs filling. It&rsquo;s things we don&rsquo;t want to think about, deal with.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s also strength in letting go. Items, places, people. Thoughts. Ideas. It&rsquo;s a way of growth. To become a better version of yourself, you need to be destroyed a little. Deal with the darkness within.</p>

<p>Some days it&rsquo;s exhausting, some days it&rsquo;s revitalizing. But that&rsquo;s why I do what I do.</p>

    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/living-in-a-car-for-5000-miles</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have set on my journey across the United States and back a few months ago.
It&rsquo;s a fun thing to do, and really gave me a breath of fresh air. I watched
elephant seals and whales on a California coast, spent what felt like days
stuck in LA traffic, ran from a blizzard, made it through a flash flood, passed
a tornado, celebrated New Year&rsquo;s on the road&hellip;</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t let me get ahead of myself.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-with-the-hills-behind-it.jpg" title="Prius with a beautiful view on the hills behind it." ></p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s inside</h2>

<p>My path started in San Francisco Bay Area, a place I&rsquo;ve been lately calling
home. I tried out <a href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/urban-prius-living/">living out of a Prius</a> before, thus not having a sturdy
place to call home wasn&rsquo;t really a shock. After only a few weeks I didn&rsquo;t feel
like anything is out of place - being on a road feels just as normal as renting
a house.</p>

<h3>Living areas</h3>

<p>First - the packing and organization. Just like in any living space, zoning is
important. Space inside a car is separated into 5 major areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>A driver&rsquo;s seat, used solely for driving. No other activities are permitted,
and the less time is spent in the driving seat - the better. This helps one
to stay alert when on a road.</li>
<li>Front passenger seat. There&rsquo;s not enough room to sit here due to the seat
being moved to the front all the way (to give the most space for the bed). I
usually just keep a backpack here (which I always take with me, so this area
stays empty when I&rsquo;m not in the car).</li>
<li>Rear passenger seat behind a driver. This is a primary seat for activities -
reading, fiddling around with a laptop, having some tea or a snack. A cooler
is taking up the leg space, but it&rsquo;s never a problem: in the wilderness I put
it outside, and nine times out of ten I don&rsquo;t want to sit with my legs down
(since that&rsquo;s the position I drive in).</li>
<li>A bed. Level surface, approximately 6 and a half feet long. Sleeping mat,
winter queen sized sleeping bag folded in two as a second mattress, a summer
sleeping bag, two pillows, and a plaid on top (for added coziness).</li>
<li>Additional cargo storage under the bed. Water supply, out-of-season clothes,
shoes.</li>
<li>Cargo area in the rear. A suitcase with food and clothes, toiletry kit, and
miscellaneous stuff. Some things I don&rsquo;t access often are in a secondary cargo
compartment Prius has underneath the cargo surface.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/view-of-prius-interior-from-the-rear.jpg" title="View of the car interior with the rear door open: suitcase on the left, and a bed on the right." ></p>

<p>After about a week, moving between the areas within a car becomes surprisingly
easy and natural. I usually put on a hand brake, lock the car, leave my shoes
in a driver&rsquo;s seat and move to the back sit or the bed.</p>

<h3>Food, water, and cooking</h3>

<p>Being prepared is essential for living on the road, so I keep a lot of food and
water in the car. I make it a rule of thumb to keep 6-8 3-liter water jugs in
the car, which amounts to 18-24 liters (5-6 gallons) of drinking water.</p>

<p>For boiling water I use <a href="http://amzn.to/1Pj5kpe">RoadPro Smart Car Pot</a>. I&rsquo;ll upgrade to something
better eventually, since it requires me to plan too far in advance - it takes
20-25 minutes to get water to boil.</p>

<p>I also have teabags and coffee with me. I used to have instant coffee, but it
tastes terrible compared to the real thing. Now I use a simple one-cup coffee
maker (the one where coffee drips through a funnel) to brew my pre-ground
coffee.</p>

<p>When it comes to food - I use rice, grains, and pasta as a base for some meals.
Canned goods like corn, peas, mixed veggies, pasta sauce, or chili add a nice
touch to the base. I heat up canned soups with a backpacking stove when I&rsquo;m not
in the mood for cooking whole meals or doing the dishes.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/making-dinner-in-the-dark.jpg" title="Making dinner in the dark." ></p>

<p>I have a <a href="http://amzn.to/1Pj5BbN">16-qt Stanley Adventure Cooler</a> which keeps items inside cold for
nearly three days (or practically indefinitely if I&rsquo;m up in the mountains where
it&rsquo;s cold). When I&rsquo;m preparing to be out in the wild, I fill it up with eggs,
meat, cheese, veggies, fruits, and berries.</p>

<p>In addition to everything listed above I always carry 6 days worth of MREs and
water in an <a href="http://amzn.to/1meZgWz">emergency backpack</a> underneath in the cargo compartment in case
I am ever stranded somewhere.</p>

<h3>Washing the dishes</h3>

<p>For cleaning my cookware I&rsquo;m using a backpacking approach I&rsquo;ve read about on
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clean-Dishes-on-a-Camping-Trip#Spray_and_Wash_sub">WikiHow</a>. I spray the dishes with some natural cleaning solution, let them
sit for a bit, wipe it off with paper towels, and then thoroughly rinse
degreased dishes off in a 5-liter travel kitchen sink.</p>

<h3>Clothing</h3>

<p>Most of my clothing is pretty regular - pants, T-shirts, shirts, cardigans,
sweaters, jackets. However I did switch to using merino wool for all my base
layers: underwear, socks, compression tops and bottoms. While being
significantly more expensive, merino wool is much more comfortable to wear, and
it stays clean for much longer than normal clothes.</p>

<p>All the things I wear day to day fit in a backpack. When I stayed in New York
City for a few weeks without a car I had everything I needed in it:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/backpack-filled-with-stuff.jpg" title="Backpack filled with clothes." ></p>

<p>In addition to all of the above, I carry a few pairs of shoes and an additional
outer layer I wear when I anticipate to be near a campfire. That goes in a
storage bin under the bed.</p>

<h3>Laundry</h3>

<p>I started with visiting laundromats and just carrying a lot of coins with me.
But after a while, a number of items which require hand washing or delicate
care have increased - mostly due to above specified merino wool base layers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for an excuse to try out <a href="http://amzn.to/1QdUGjt">Scrubba wash bag</a> I&rsquo;ve heard so
much about - basically a dry sack for washing clothes. I found it to be quite
convenient and not at all cumbersome to use.</p>

<p>While I still use laundromats for washing bulkier items, I hand wash my easy to
clean and quick to dry base layers.</p>

<h3>Sleeping</h3>

<p>A self-inflating sleeping pad and a winter queen-sized sleeping bag folded in
half create a great mattress. I sleep in a summer sleeping bag, with an added
sleeping bag liner and a few travel pillows.</p>

<p>I run AC in the car throughout the night. While keeping the temperature
pleasant, it tends to dry out the air and results in a major case of a sore
throat in a morning. I use a small travel humidifier which connects to a USB
power supply to regulate the humidity in the car at night.</p>

<h3>Entertainment</h3>

<p>Boredom seems to never be a concern with this lifestyle. I use laptop for rare
acts of writing, and a Kindle for reading during the little downtime I have. I
also have a little harmonica I hope I&rsquo;ll learn to play one day. And some
juggling balls I throw around once in a while.</p>

<h2>A few words on stealth</h2>

<p>While I enjoy staying at campsites, a large portion of my journey involved
staying in urban areas. Looking inconspicious is a big deal when you&rsquo;re relaxing
in a car - it&rsquo;s not fun when somebody comes knocking on your door (didn&rsquo;t happen
to me though).</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/hiding-in-plain-sight.jpg" title="Hiding in plain sight between rental cars." ></p>

<p>The fact that it&rsquo;s a white-ish Prius helps a lot. Car dwelling is not a first
thing people think when they see a tiny city car parked on the side of the road.
Tinted windows (heavier tint in the rear, lighter in the front) are enough to
shield the dweller from the passers by. A blackout curtain separating the front
seats from the back area and covering rear windows is enough to cover one from
curious eyes peering inside the car.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the car looks in ful lighting with the curtains down, if you look
closely you can see the black fabric behind the seat backs. But most likely
you&rsquo;ll just pass the car:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-in-an-underground-parking-garage.jpg" title="Prius in an underground parking garage with the curtains down." ></p>

<p>Finding a place to stay boils down to four simple steps for me:</p>

<ol>
<li>Drive around in advance, find a place where it&rsquo;s easy to blend it. I prefer a
balance between empty and fully crowded lots. Avoid parking at a chosen area
until later in the evening.</li>
<li>Arrive late, hide in plain sight, park near similar cars. Don&rsquo;t tuck in
somewhere far and look suspicious.</li>
<li>Be respectful to whichever place you picked for the night. If possible, leave
it cleaner than it was when you arrived. Try not to be in and out of the car
too much either.</li>
<li>Leave early. Do not stay at one place multiple nights in a row. Avoid easily
recognizable patterns when returning to the same spot.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Final thoughts about my journey</h2>

<p>I traveled for an approximate of three weeks, and ended up hunkering down in New
York City for another month while leaving a car outside the city.</p>

<p>I gave up my apartment back in Bay Area for the duration of the travel, and it
feels liberating. It&rsquo;s comforting to know that one doesn&rsquo;t need to own a place
to live a happy and fulfilled life. Even further, living in NYC for weeks with a
single backpack worth of posessions and realising I don&rsquo;t need anything else was
an eye opening experience.</p>

<p>Turns out I really don&rsquo;t need much stuff to enjoy life.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As requested, I took some detailed pictures of the
<a href="http://amzn.to/1NvY78S">Prius Camper Conversion Kit</a> I mentioned in my <a href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/urban-prius-living">previous article</a>. It
adds valuable space to the back of the car when the seats are down, and helps to
push down the seats all the way in order to achieve a level surface. This
particular kit works for third generation of Prius, but can be slightly
modified to fit other models. In theory, something like this can work with any
car, as long as the rear seats can be forced down all the way to create a flat
surface (170 pounds of my bodyweight was enough to flatten out the seat back).</p>

<p>This is how the final conversion looks, with a mat cut to a custom shape on top
of it:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-camper-final.jpg" title="This is how the final conversion looks." ></p>

<p>A wooden platform which is used to fill up rear leg space. Notice the blue
strap on the rear seat, that&rsquo;s what pushes down the seat to create a level
surface:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-camper-with-the-mat-up.jpg" title="Wooden surface underneath the mat." ></p>

<p>The lid can be removed for storage space access:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-camper-with-the-lid-off.jpg" title="Wooden platform with the lid off." ></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a relatively thin wooden platform. Top (on the picture) side of it is a
bit slanted to fit on a rear seat back:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-camper-wooden-platform-top.jpg" title="Top view of the wooden platform." ></p>

<p>View from the bottom: metal pieces are there to hold platform legs when the
platform is not in use, but I don&rsquo;t find them necessary. Additional (darker)
piece of wood is what the lid rests on:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-camper-wooden-platform-bottom.jpg" title="Bottom view of the wooden platform." ></p>

<p>View from the side:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-camper-wooden-platform-side.jpg" title="Side view of the wooden platform." ></p>

<p>With passenger front seat pushed all the way forward (and seat back in further
possible forward position), wooden supports are inserted into exposed seat
railing. I added some duct tape layers at the bottom of each leg so that they
don&rsquo;t wobble when the wooden platform is removed.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-camper-wooden-legs.jpg" title="Wooden supports for the platform." ></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a right leg:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-camper-wooden-legs-right.jpg" title="Right wooden support." ></p>

<p>I noticed that the left leg needed to be approximately 5 mm longer in order for
the platform not to wobble, so I extended it with whatever I had on hand:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-camper-wooden-legs-left.jpg" title="Left wooden support." ></p>

<p>Adjustable belt with a hook on one side and a strap tie on the other:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-camper-belt-with-a-hook.jpg" title="Belt with a hook." ></p>

<p>On the back side of rear seats there are places to secure a baby seat. I removed
the plastic covers (use some force), and attached a strap there. I added a piece
of cloth to (hopefully) prevent damage to seat fabric:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-camper-belt-on-the-rear-seat.jpg" title="Belt on the rear seat." ></p>

<p>Tricky part is getting the bottom hook in the right place. Rear seats are held
in place by two metal locks. If you grab a rear seat from the bottom (when the
back is not folded) and pull up with approximately 50-100 pounds of force, the
seat will snap out of the place exposing the lock. Attach a hook to the exposed
part of the locking mechanism. Jump down on a seat to snap the rear seat back in
place. Exercise caution while you make your way through this, took me nearly an
hour to figure out how to properly attach a hook and snap the seat back in
place:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-camper-bottom-hook.jpg" title="Bottom hook on the belt." ></p>

<p>When both sides of the belt are in place, fold the rear seat, push in down with
your body weight, and tighten the belt.</p>

    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/urban-prius-living</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not so long ago I stumbled upon a blog titled <a href="https://chrissawey.wordpress.com/">&ldquo;Hotel Prius&rdquo;</a>, and I loved
the idea. Being a Prius owner myself, I decided to give Prius living a test run.
Being cautious person I am, I decided to give it a test run for a week in a
familiar area.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-in-a-corporate-area.jpg" title="A Prius." ></p>

<h2>Preparing for the journey</h2>

<p>First, I decided to tint my windows. In addition to making a Prius look much
more pleasant, it keeps the car cooler throughout the day, and most importantly
makes it hard to peek inside the car. Especially at night.</p>

<p>Next, I ordered a <a href="http://amzn.to/1NvY78S">Prius Gen III Camping Sleeper Conversion Kit</a>. It&rsquo;s just a
fancy name for two belts to push down the rear seats, and two wooden platforms
with detachable feet to cover leg space. And two custom cut carpet runners to
cover up the panels. Nothing one can&rsquo;t make in their own garage, if the money is
tight.</p>

<p>The kit requires front seats to be locked in the furthest possible position,
rendering them unusable. So I only installed a panel behind a passenger seat.
With the panel installed, I have nearly 7 feet of level surface to sleep on.</p>

<p>Another problem with the kit is that it blocks the console from being opened
(arm rest storage between driver and passenger seat). I stopped using console as
a quick access box, and it doesn&rsquo;t feel like a big loss.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-sleeping-platform.jpg" title="Sleeping platform. Laundry bag at the bottom." ></p>

<p>I packed all my clothes in a duffle bag, bought a small toiletries kit, and put
the rest of my belongings in a backpack. Queen-sized sleeping bag I had came in
handy as a bed (with a couple of travel pillows).</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-duffle-bag-and-a-sleeping-bag.jpg" title="Duffle bag with clothes and a sleeping bag." ></p>

<p>After a second night I swapped my sleeping bag with a lighter and more compact
summer sleeping bag. That&rsquo;s also when I added a 1.5 inch sleeping pad to my
inventory.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-in-a-sleeping-position.jpg" title="Prius in a sleeping position, with toiletries kit and a duffle bag on the left, sleeping bag on the right." ></p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-bed-view-from-drivers-seat.jpg" title="View of a bed from the driver's seat." ></p>

<p>My backpack/briefcase is on the passenger&rsquo;s seat, I always take it with me.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-backpack-on-the-front-seat.jpg" title="Backpack on the passenger seat." ></p>

<p>In addition to all of the above, I took my guitar - even though it&rsquo;s bigger than
anything else I had to take with me, it&rsquo;s a great source of entertainment.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-guitar-and-bed-view.jpg" title="Guitar with a travel pillow on top, old backpack (now replaced)." ></p>

<h2>Sleeping in a Prius</h2>

<h3>Night one</h3>

<p>First night in a Prius left me with mixed feelings. I parked in one of the
corporate areas of the city at about 9 pm. I picked a well lit parking lot with
some (but not much) evening traffic. I parked in one of the slightly darker
areas of the parking lot (approximately one out of twenty parking spots was
taken, and large number of cars made me feel safer).</p>

<p>It was 74F outside, slowly cooling after a 100F day. I left my car in accessory
mode (spoiler: bad idea), turned on the AC, locked the doors, and hopped on my
bedding arrangement to the back of the car. I didn&rsquo;t want to keep the windows
open since I just got them tinted. And sleeping with windows rolled down felt a
bit eerie.</p>

<p>First thing I noticed was how obnoxiously bright instrument panel and GPS are.
It was the opposite of stealthy, and it was plain annoying to sleep with those
bright lights on. I reached out for my duffle bag, and pulled out a couple of
towels to cover up both the instrument panel and GPS, as well as few AC control
LEDs. This made me feel at ease, and I tried to doze off into sleep.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-towels-on-instrument-panel.jpg" title="Towels covering an instrument panel and a GPS." ></p>

<p>The parking lot lights were a minor annoyance, mostly filtered out by a 20% rear
window tint. I&rsquo;ve heard some people pass somewhere within 20 feet of my car a
few times, but other than that it was quiet. Still, unfamiliar situation made it
hard to fall asleep.</p>

<p>And then a few voices and an engine noise disturbed my peace, pretty close to my
car. I waited for about 10 minutes, and the noise didn&rsquo;t go away. I raised my
head to see what&rsquo;s happening - turns out someone had a tire blowout a 2 parking
spots away from me, and a pickup truck pulled in next to them to help with
changing the tire. There were anywhere between 3 and 5 people walking around and
talking.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when I quickly got dressed, climbed to a driver&rsquo;s seat, and drove off to
look for a quieter spot. It was 9:55 pm.</p>

<p>I went to a more secluded, but still well lit parking lot behind one of the
offices. Concentration of cars was about the same, but it looked like those cars
were left there overnight. I picked a spot within 50 feet of other parked cars,
where a tree was covering my car from the harsh street light.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-parking-spot-by-the-tree.jpg" title="Parking spot by the tree." ></p>

<p>Accessory mode, AC, lock the doors. Climbed in the back, and after some
restlessness (a fairly normal thing for me), I fell asleep. I woke up sometime
around 11:30 pm. It was fairly hot in the car, and it was hard to breathe. Turns
out accessory mode turned itself off at some point. Maybe the battery ran low,
or maybe there&rsquo;s a time limit of sort. I opened all the doors to air out a car
for a couple of minutes while I walked around and stretched.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I also noticed that because of the tinted windows, it&rsquo;s nearly
impossible to see what&rsquo;s inside the car while only standing a few feet away
from it. That was comforting.</p>

<p>Second attempt, this time I turned on the car the usual way (by depressing the
pedal). I used a foot brake for a peace of mind, set the AC to 68 degrees (with
external air flow setting), locked the car, covered the instrument panel and a
GPS, and climbed in the back.</p>

<p>AC was blowing on my neck, but I was too tired to worry about it. The car cooled
down and I climbed inside a sleeping bag (it was too hot before, and I was just
lying on top of it). I&rsquo;m used to sleeping on hard surfaces, so the setup felt
comfortable enough. The light from surrounding light poles was a bit too harsh,
so I covered my eyes with a T-shirt. I fell asleep.</p>

<p>I woke up a few times throughout the night, but I feel like I&rsquo;ve had enough
sleep. I woke up with the sun at about 6:30 am, got dressed, opened all doors to
ventilate the car, packed away a sleeping bag, and drove to work. I felt well
rested, even though my throat and neck felt a bit sore from the AC directed at
me.</p>

<p>Oh, and it cost me $1.40 to have an AC running through the night. The car would
turn on for about a minute every once in a while (30 minutes?) to recharge the
battery.</p>

<h3>Night two</h3>

<p>This time, I found a perfect spot in a small parking lot behind an office. Less
crowded than the previous time, but still well lit. I got lucky and found a
space with no direct street light being visible when laying down.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-parked-in-a-small-lot.jpg" title="Prius parked in a small parking lot." ></p>

<p>Turn the car on, AC to 68 degrees, lock the doors, hop to the back seat.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve slept well for the first couple of hours, but I ended up waking up well
rested at midnight. I stopped by my office and worked for a couple of hours.
Back to the car to get 4 more hours of sleep.</p>

<p>It cost me $1.38 to camp through the night with AC on.</p>

<h3>Night three</h3>

<p>My sleeping bag was too hot to use at room temperature, so I swapped it with a
summer down filled bag. I also purchased a self-inflating sleeping pad for more
comfort.</p>

<p>Things are getting better from now on.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-on-top-of-a-parking-garage.jpg" title="Prius on top of a parking garage." ></p>

<p>Feeling more confident, I found a four-story corporate parking lot and drove to
the top level. I parked at a well-lit spot without any direct lights coming
through the windows. I easily fell asleep a tad bit past nine, and woke up at 6
am refreshed and well rested. Secluded spot, comfortable sleeping pad, summer
sleeping bag, and increased confidence - all contributed to making sleeping in a
Prius a delightful experience.</p>

<p>This was also the night I learned a neat trick: if you recline the driver&rsquo;s seat
all the way, it becomes really easy to move between front seat and a sleeping
area.</p>

<p>Cost of running the car through the night: $1.63.</p>

<h3>Night four</h3>

<p>I decided to camp out in the same multi-level parking garage I did yesterday (it
has high enough number of cars so that I don&rsquo;t stand out - about one per fifty
parking spots; and the foot traffic is very low to non-existent). I found
another part of the garage with a roof access on a second level and pulled in
there. After getting situated, I realized I didn&rsquo;t account for all the lights -
bright parking lot lights from other levels ended up shining right in my face.
And even though I knew I couldn&rsquo;t be seen behind the tinted windows, it did
leave me feeling exposed.</p>

<p>I slid to the driver&rsquo;s seat and drove up a few levels to the previous spot.
Doors are locked, AC is set to 68F, instrument panel is covered, driver&rsquo;s seat
is reclined. I climbed to the back, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>It was a warm night, temperature outside was at 73F. It was hot enough for me to
wake up two times through the night, but that was a minor inconvenience.</p>

<p>Cost: $1.73.</p>

<h3>Night five</h3>

<p>It was one of the chillier nights, so sleeping was a very pleasant experience. I
picked the same spot I used on the third night. Absence of direct lights visible
from the car windows plays a huge role in making you feel safe.</p>

<p>Cost: $1.53 while also bringing Nexus 6 to a full charge.</p>

<h3>Night six</h3>

<p>Picked another spot in a similar area, I parked under a broken street light in a
well lit parking lot. I&rsquo;ve slept well. Mostly due to this being a cooler night
(65F).</p>

<p>Cost: $1.29 while also bringing Nexus 6 to a full charge.</p>

<h3>Night seven</h3>

<p>I was stuck in traffic in the evening, and I fiddled with the GPS for a while.
Turns out you can disable the obnoxiously bright screen by going into &ldquo;Setup&rdquo;
-> &ldquo;Display&rdquo; -> &ldquo;Screen off&rdquo;. Pushing any button on the GPS turns the screen
back on. I&rsquo;m still using the towels to cover up the instrument panel and AC
controls though.</p>

<p>Another fairly cold night, which made sleeping more comfortable. I went back to
the top of the parking garage. Night was a delight.</p>

<p>Cost: $1.39, with full Nexus 6 charging.</p>

<h3>Impressions</h3>

<p>Stealthy living in a Prius is very comfortable. With tinted windows there&rsquo;s just
enough privacy, it&rsquo;s safe and cheap to run AC through the night (cost averages
to about $1.48 per night). There&rsquo;s more than enough space for someone of my
height (5&#8217;11&#8221;). It took me a couple of days to get used to feeling relatively
exposed in public, but once I did - it was a breeze. Last five nights I have
slept without any problems.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, I&rsquo;ve slept better in a Prius than I did in my own bed. Here I
should probably note that I&rsquo;ve been having troubles sleeping on an off for some
time lately, and sleeping through the night in a car was a step up from where I
was before.</p>

<h3>Lessons learned</h3>

<p>Some things I didn&rsquo;t know before trying out sleeping in a Prius:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pick a well lit parking lot, ideally with some cars of similar value parked
overnight. Make sure there&rsquo;s not too much foot traffic.</li>
<li>Park in an area without direct light source near you. Also account for lights
visible from inside the car (light nearly a hundred feet away can still be
bother).</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re using the AC, turn Prius engine on instead of leaving it in
accessory mode.</li>
<li>Proper AC vent direction is important. Fiddle with those until there are no
drafts in the sleeping area.</li>
<li>Use a sleeping mask to avoid being bothered by the lights if you couldn&rsquo;t find
area without visible light sources shining directly through the windows.</li>
<li>Since the temperature inside the car is regulated, summer sleeping bag is a
must.</li>
<li>Sleeping pad is very helpful in making the surface softer. 1.5 inches made a
huge difference in comfort.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Items I used</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-storage-compartment.jpg" title="Storage compartment. Left to right, top to bottom: a travel pillow, miscellaneous items storage box, sleeping pad, sleeping bag, a book (I'm not an avid reader these days), emergency supplies backpack, 10000 mAh power bank, paper towels." ></p>

already owned.</p>

<ul>

<h2>Future improvement ideas</h2>

<p>I have a great stealthy setup, but having more privacy would&rsquo;ve been a nice
bonus. I&rsquo;ll probably look for some inconspicuous looking shades or curtains,
provided that the setup doesn&rsquo;t look too obvious.</p>

<h2>Philosophical implications</h2>

<p>This was an interesting experience. Inability to retreat to the safety of my
house got me out of my comfort zone. Initial discomfort passed quickly, and a
world of possibilities opened up to me.</p>

<p>Not having access to a house made me, well, feel bored. And that&rsquo;s amazing.
Without having an ability to default to a TV, gaming platform, or even a laptop
(it&rsquo;s really not that comfortable to work on a laptop in a car) - I had to get
creative. I got to play a guitar, a piano, sing, practice with a drum set. I
worked on my blog (this article took multiple revisions and hours upon hours of
time to look the way it does now). I went to Mozzart&rsquo;s Don Giovanni publicly
hosted in a nearby town.</p>

<p>And I finished this article, which took me about 8 days of revisions and
additions to finish.</p>

<p>Now, thanks to self-imposed restrictions, I&rsquo;m doing all the things I wanted to
do.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a perpetual planner. And that sometimes becomes a problem, since I&rsquo;m always
looking forward to the next thing that&rsquo;s going to happen, sometimes not paying
attention to life right in front of me. With everything I have packed in a car,
there&rsquo;s nothing on the horizon. Nothing is far away. There&rsquo;s no home to go back
to, so I don&rsquo;t rush anywhere. I savor every moment I have.</p>

    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/my-experience-with-minimalism/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-18T19:54:36+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/my-experience-with-minimalism</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Minimalism was always appealing to me. The philosophy of not having more than
one would need is close to my heart. Over the past few years, I&rsquo;ve been
&ldquo;trimming the fat&rdquo; off various parts of my life.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t recall when I started being drawn to a minimalistic lifestyle. I think
my passion for minimalism originates in my desire for organization and order.
It&rsquo;s comforting to know that a world around me has a certain structure.</p>

<p>I remember the time when I started living on my own. I just moved to United
States, away from my family. All my life fit in a half-empty suitcase at that
time. Few sets of clothes, a blanket, a pillow, some hygiene products, a small
laptop. Moving to a new place was as easy as throwing few things in that
suitcase.</p>

<p>After some time, I started accumulating more things. A guitar. More variations
of clothing. Cheap coffee table and a shoe rack from a dollar store. At that
time I rented a room in one of the shady areas of the city. Adding a few pieces
of furniture made a place feel like home.</p>

<p>Time has passed, and I moved again. Left the furniture behind, took the rest.
Still light, but I did have to make a few trips to move everything I needed. I
got even more comfortable. A gaming PC. Significantly more junk here and there.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when I did my first big cleanup. I went through every item I owned, and
tossed it a trash bag if I didn&rsquo;t use it in the past 6 month. Old clothes, some
action figures, other useless junk I accumulated. As a result, I tossed two big
bags of stuff I didn&rsquo;t need. I still remember the liberating feeling. Knowing
that everything I own serves a purpose.</p>

<p>It felt like I could breathe again.</p>

<p>Years pass. I don&rsquo;t rent rooms anymore, but apartments, houses. This comes with
having to own more things. Real furniture. A TV. More musical instruments.
Having to accommodate guests. Cooking supplies. A bike. Outdoor furniture.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve kept the minimalistic mindset, and I still do periodical clean outs.
Tossing almost everything I haven&rsquo;t used in a past six months. Reducing what I
own only to things that I need to have comfortable and enjoyable living.</p>

<p>Today, I don&rsquo;t think I can fit everything I own in that single suitcase. Hell, I
most certainly will need to hire a truck for my next move. But that&rsquo;s not
important. Minimalism isn&rsquo;t about the absence of things. If you feel like you
don&rsquo;t have enough - you&rsquo;re probably doing something wrong. Minimalism is about
not being excessive.</p>

<p>For me, knowing that my belongings serve a purpose makes me feel content,
clear-headed. It&rsquo;s comforting. It feels right.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I forget and start accumulating stuff. And that&rsquo;s when I go back to
reducing again. It&rsquo;s not an obsession, but a healthy periodical maintenance.

    <updated>2015-07-15T17:07:53+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/profiling-slow-bashrc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve recently noticed that it takes a long time for my bash to load. I&rsquo;ve found
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/5015179/2578489">following StackOverflow answer</a> to be useful, and I based my solution to find a
startup time hog in my <code>~/.bashrc</code> upon it.</p>

<p>First off, add following few lines to your <code>/etc/bash.bashrc</code>,
<code>~/.bash_profile</code>, or wherever you&rsquo;d like to begin tracing the script:</p>

<pre><code>PS4='+ $(date "+%s.%N")\011 '
exec 3&gt;&amp;2 2&gt;/tmp/bashstart.$$.log
set -x
</code></pre>

<p>And add following few lines where you want to stop the trace:</p>

<pre><code>set +x
exec 2&gt;&amp;3 3&gt;&amp;-
</code></pre>

<p>Now start your bash session (you can simply open a new terminal Window for
that). The above will create <code>/tmp/bashstart.&lt;PID&gt;.log</code>. To analyze it, I wrote
a little Python script:</p>

<pre><code>import argparse
import heapq

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Analyze bashstart log for speed.')
parser.add_argument('filename', help='often /tmp/bashstart.&lt;PID&gt;.log')
parser.add_argument('-n', default=20, help='number of results to show')
args = parser.parse_args()
filename, n = args.filename, int(args.n)

with open(filename, 'r') as f:
    q = []
    prev_time = None
    for line in f.readlines():
        line = line.split()
        if '+' not in line[0] or len(line) &lt; 3:
            continue
        text = ' '.join(line[2:])
        seconds, nanoseconds = line[1].split('.')
        time = int(nanoseconds)
        diff = time - prev_time if prev_time is not None else 0
        prev_time = time
        heapq.heappush(q, (diff, text))

for diff, text in heapq.nlargest(n, q):
    print float(diff) / 1000000000, 's:', text
</code></pre>

<p>Save it as <code>bashprofile.py</code>, and run it as follows (replace file name with an
appropriate):</p>

<pre><code>python bashprofile.py /tmp/bashstart.2831.log -n 20
0.050056909 s: _powerline_init_tmux_support

</code></pre>

<p>In my example, <a href="https://github.com/powerline/powerline">Powerline</a> turned out to be a massive hog. Looks like I&rsquo;ll
have to troubleshoot the speed or plain disable it.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to remove the lines you added to your bash configuration files
after you&rsquo;re done profiling.</p>

    <updated>2015-06-10T20:02:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/didyoumean-plugin-for-vim</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://github.com/EinfachToll/DidYouMean">DidYouMean</a> Vim plugin is very simple: it asks you if the file you are
trying to open is indeed the right file. How is this useful? Here&rsquo;s how:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/vim-plugin-didyoumean.png" title="DidYouMean plugin in action." ></p>

<p>Say you have two files with a similarly starting names: <code>model.py</code> and
<code>model_test.py</code>. You type <code>vim mo</code>, you hit tab to autocomplete the name, you
hit enter. In vanilla Vim, you&rsquo;d be opening a new file: <code>model</code>, since that&rsquo;s
where shell&rsquo;s tab-completion stopped. DidYouMean detects such a nuance and asks
you if you wanted to open <code>model</code>, <code>model.py</code>, or <code>model_test.py</code>.</p>

<p>Simple idea, and instantly after trying this out, I would really expect this
feature to be included in vanilla Vim.</p>

    <updated>2015-06-08T22:03:58+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/lessons-learned-engineering-productivity</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I enjoy optimizing the way I work: the less time I can spend on something
without sacrificing quality - the better. Below are few ideas on the subject of
engineering productivity I&rsquo;ve successfully applied in my career.</p>

<h2>Don&rsquo;t work long hours</h2>

<p>A fascinating paper was released in 2011 by a group of Israeli researchers, who
studied the factors which affect if prisoners were given a parole or not
(source: <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889.abstract">Extraneous factors in judicial decisions</a>.</p>

<p>First prisoner in a morning has approximately 65% chance of being released. With
every next case, the chance dropped significantly, reaching nearly 0% starting
with the third case. After returning from a lunch break, odds of a prisoner
being released went back up to 65%. And once again, with each new prisoner the
odds decline rapidly.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/israeli-parole-study.gif" title="A graph of favorable parole decisions given by the judges." ></p>

<p>Authors of the paper suggest that making decisions depletes a limited mental
facility. People start looking for shortcuts and making mistakes.</p>

<p>Working long hours is something we&rsquo;ve all done more than once. Be it an upcoming
deadline, fascinating problem, or a personal project. The problem with working
too long is that you&rsquo;re doing a poor job without realizing it.</p>

<p>I try to avoid working more than 7 hours a day, and there are people who get an
incredible amount of work done under an even shorter amount of time.</p>

<p>This is probably explained by a phenomenon called &ldquo;ego depletion&rdquo;: the idea that
self-control or willpower draw upon a pool of limited mental resources that can
be used up. When the energy for mental activity is low, self-control is
typically impaired, which is what is considered to be a state of ego depletion.</p>

<h2>Dangers of burning out</h2>

<p>Another problem with working too long - is a possibility of a burnout.</p>

<p>A while back I worked as a freelancer for a client of mine. I worked long hours
from home office. This was my first time working from home for such a long
period of time, and I made a number of mistakes in the beginning. One of which
was working too much.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve put in a number of 12-hour marathons in order to get more work done. I was
on call most of the time. I became overwhelmed with all the work I had to get
done. I started losing interest in work and feeling like things are getting out
of my control. Every day felt like a bad day.</p>

<p>Those are the symptoms of a burnout. Feeling of life spinning out of control
and feeling like nothing you do makes any impact.</p>

<p>I broke out of a mental prison of a burnout by getting a better work-life
balance, enforcing exercise routine, and never working more than 8 hours a day.
7 in most cases.</p>

<h2>Work-life balance</h2>

<p>Another thing I learned from working from home is how to keep a work-life
balance. Not having a separate office and living in a 1-bedroom apartment with
my wife, I had to barricade myself in a far corner of a bedroom and turn it into
a physically separated office space. That was the space I worked in, and it
remained empty after I was done and until I started the next work day.</p>

<p>Work-life balance deserves a special say: it&rsquo;s the difference between doing an
amazing job and going insane. Set aside time and place for work, and never allow
a bleed-through. Don&rsquo;t be on call if you can avoid it. Don&rsquo;t open or reply to
work-related emails at your spare time. Office is for work and home is for
family.</p>

<h2>Distraction-free environment</h2>

<p>Everybody is aware that interruptions hamper productivity, but not everyone
actively avoids interruptions during work. Replying to a text message, quickly
checking your social network notifications, or looking up that one thing you&rsquo;ve
been forgetting to look up for days - all of this impairs your mental ability to
complete the task within a desired time frame and, more importantly, with high
quality.</p>

<p>According to various studies it takes from 20 to 30 minutes to get regain the
same level of concentration and productivity after a single act of disruption. A
<a href="http://hfs.sagepub.com/content/56/7/1262">2014 study from George Mason University</a> found that students composed lower
quality essays when interrupted only a few times throughout both planning and
writing phases. Distracted students performed considerably worse, even though
they were given additional time to complete an assignment in order to make up
for the interruptions.</p>

<h2>Know your tools</h2>

<blockquote><p>Use a single editor well</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1B1PWw8">Pragmatic Programmer</a>, Tip #22.</li>
</ul>


<p>This is lower level tip than the rest, but something I find utterly important in
my daily work. We, the software engineers, spend at least half the time editing
some sort of text - code, email, documentation. Taking time to improve the
knowledge of the software you use every day pays off.</p>

<ul>
<li>Using Gmail? Learn the keyboard shortcuts.</li>
<li>Use Eclispe? Do the same. Search for plugins which can make your everyday work
faster and easier.</li>
<li>Use command shell for daily work? Practice your shell scripting skills, find
the tools that let you do more work with lesser amount of typing.</li>
<li>Pick up touch typing. It&rsquo;s also a part of your toolbox. Why think about keying
words in? Lower error rate while typing - you need to go back less.</li>
</ul>


<p>For instance, I do all my work in shell. I use <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net">Tmux</a> for creating and
navigating multiple sessions. I use Vim for all my editing needs - code,
documentation, blogging, composing long emails (via <a href="http://www.mutt.org">Mutt</a>). I touch type, so
working in a text mode is easy.</p>

<p>Over the years I accumulated aliases for all the frequently used shell commands.
All the Vim and Tmux shortcuts are a part of a muscle memory. Jumping from file
to file or from one place to another within a file doesn&rsquo;t take any mental
effort and is accomplished with only a couple of keystrokes.</p>

<p>By eliminating the need to think about or spend too much time working with low
level concepts - you free up the mental bandwidth for higher level reasoning and
problem solving.</p>

<h2>Read, don&rsquo;t stop learning</h2>

<p>As per DeMarco and Lister, authors of
<a href="http://amzn.to/1D2csza">&ldquo;Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams&rdquo;</a> - one book is more than most
programmers read each year. This is the same point Steve McConnell&rsquo;s
<a href="http://amzn.to/1D2cB5K">&ldquo;Code Complete&rdquo;</a> emphasizes.</p>

<p>A lot of programmers don&rsquo;t read books. A few even don&rsquo;t follow relevant blogs
or websites. Don&rsquo;t do what software engineers had to do in the olden days:
coding by error in isolation from the rest of the industry. Read a book, learn
something you don&rsquo;t know about. A single book read from beginning to end
contains wider array of information compared to disjointed articles some
programmers limit themselves to.</p>

<p>As Jeff Atwood suggests in his article
<a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/programmers-dont-read-books-but-you-should/">&ldquo;Programmers Don&rsquo;t Read Books - But You Should&rdquo;</a>, pick up one of the
timeless books - not affected by changing technologies and processes.</p>

    <updated>2015-06-07T20:10:15+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/gundo-tree-for-vim</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the obscure, but tremendously useful features of Vim is an undo tree.
You would expect Vim to have a simple stack for undo and redo actions, but it&rsquo;s
much more complex than that: Vim keeps track of every change you made in the
current session, making it possible to access change history beyond basic <code>u</code>
and <code>C-r</code> commands.</p>

<p>Default interface for accessing far out branches of the undo tree leaves to be
desired, but that&rsquo;s where <a href="http://sjl.bitbucket.org/gundo.vim/">Gundo</a> comes in.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/vim-gundo-tree.png" title="Gundo tree in Vim." ></p>

<p>Gundo provides an easy to use interface for navigating history branches. In the
screenshot above, I am previewing a diff in one of the undo tree branches
inaccessible via <code>u</code> command.</p>

<p>As per author&rsquo;s recommendation, I mapped the plugin to <code>F5</code>, which seems quite
convenient to me:</p>

<pre><code>nnoremap &lt;F5&gt; :GundoToggle&lt;CR&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Usage is quite easy. <code>F5</code> opens or closes the undo tree, <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> are used
to travel through changes. Enter key applies the changes.</p>

    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/my-experience-switching-to-buffers/"/>
    <updated>2015-06-01T13:28:42+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/my-experience-switching-to-buffers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About a year ago I stumbled upon an article explaining the difference between
Vim tabs and buffers. The author emphasized that tabs are merely window
layouts, and therefore one-file-per-tab idea I was used to at the moment just
wasn&rsquo;t proper. Instead, author suggested the use of buffer commands to switch
between multiple files. I decided to give it a shot, and here are some ideas I
would like to share after switching to the use of buffers.</p>

<p>Buffers are open files (they also may not be associated with any files), but
they&rsquo;re not necessarily visible at any given moment. In Vim, windows are not
linked to any particular buffer, so you can easily cycle through buffers from
within any window.</p>

<p>First and foremost, you probably want to add <code>set hidden</code> to your <code>.vimrc</code>.
This option lets you switch between buffers without having to save files.</p>

<p>At it&rsquo;s basics, you only need few commands for operating buffers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <code>:ls</code> to list all buffers for this session.</li>
<li>To move between next and previous buffers use <code>:bn</code> and <code>:bp</code> respectively.</li>
<li>Use <code>:b partial_buffer_name</code> for navigating to the buffer of your choice.
Buffer name auto-complete is supported.</li>
<li>You can also use <code>:bN</code>, where <code>N</code> is a buffer number to jump to a specific
buffer.</li>
<li>Get in a habit of closing buffers you will not use with <code>:bd</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/vim-list-buffers.png" title="A list of open buffers in Vim." ></p>

<p>The hardest thing about stopping to use tabs and switching to buffers instead
is not having the visual aid: I was used to having a list of files always
available at a glance, at the top of my screen. To check what files I&rsquo;m working
on now - I have to hit four keys: <code>:ls</code> (fourth being &ldquo;Enter&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, this taught me to be more mindful about my editing
experience. I usually have a clear structure of the files I&rsquo;m working on in my
head. And if the list is getting to long to easily remember, then I&rsquo;m probably
doing something wrong: time to take a break and reset my Vim session.</p>

<p>The experience overall reminded me of my recent switch to blank keyboard key
caps: with no inscriptions to aid you, I first felt a bit at loss, especially
with they keys I couldn&rsquo;t find without looking: like function keys or special
symbols. But after some time with the blank key caps, I improved my typing
skill, and know where even the most obscure characters hide. The switch helped
me to improve my typing experience overall.</p>

<p>With Vim, it&rsquo;s a similar story. After getting past the initial confusion, I
achieved high level of awareness about my editing sessions. It didn&rsquo;t make the
editing process any faster, but instead much more satisfying.</p>

<p>But you already new that, since Vim isn&rsquo;t really about speed.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Made a few corrections and added a <code>:b partial_buffer_name</code> command
thanks to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/___violet___">/u/___violet___</a>&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/382v6q/my_experience_switching_to_buffers/crrunni">Reddit comment</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/impact-driven-development/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-26T01:19:58+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/impact-driven-development</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is my fifth year working as a professional software engineer, and I think
it&rsquo;s a good time for me to share a few tips, dos, and don&#8217;ts I learned
throughout past four years. This is the first article in a series of three,
and it focuses on development process.</p>

<p>Moving towards becoming a senior engineer, I noticed paying more attention to
the impact my work produces. These days I would much rather compile a number of
small simple changes to &ldquo;wow&rdquo; the users, as opposed to building unnecessarily
complex nice-to-haves. This sounds simple and straight-forward, and some reader
might even say &ldquo;That&rsquo;s silly, everybody knows that&rdquo;. However significant number
of engineers I meet don&rsquo;t concentrate on how much impact they produce.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get caught up in a daily routine: you close an issue after issue,
there&rsquo;s a stable flow of requirements from the business meetings. It&rsquo;s not
always easy to know when to stop and think &ldquo;Do I really need to do this?&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Get the priorities right</h2>

<p>Divide amount of impact task produces by amount of effort you&rsquo;ll have to put
into completing it. Arrange the tasks by this factor.</p>

<p>More often then not you can drop items with low impact/effort ratio.</p>

<h2>Separate what is needed from what is asked</h2>

<p>Know who the stakeholders are for each task, feature, or a project you work
on.  Understand their underlying motives. Anyone can fall a victim of an
<a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/66377/184108">XY problem</a>, it is your responsibility as an engineer to make sure that
stakeholders ask for what they actually need.</p>

<h2>Know when to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;</h2>

<p>In the very beginning of my career I gladly took every single task thrown at me.
It soon became an issue: work that actually needs to get done is not getting
done quickly enough. Knowing when to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; is an art that takes practice.</p>

<h2>Think about your work</h2>

<p>Beware of routines, repeating the same workflow time after time is damaging when
it comes to building software. Stop each time before you proceed to the next
step, and ask yourself if you&rsquo;re performing the task in the best way possible.
Be mindful about your work.</p>

<h2>Be a catalyst for change</h2>

<p>Be the first to promote the change. Did you notice a poor practice on a
project? Begin a more efficient practice (if it&rsquo;s appropriate based on your
role in a team of course). Don&rsquo;t go on telling people how wrong what they use
is. Show everyone how the new way is better on practice, and your colleagues
will adopt successful trend.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t fall a victim of deferring responsibility: be aware that when multiple
people are involved, every member of a group relies on other people to get
things done. Be the one to take on responsibility when it&rsquo;s unclear who should.</p>
