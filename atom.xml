    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This review is written entirely using Vortex Core, in Markdown, and using Vim.</em></p>

<p>Earlier this week I purchased <a href="https://amzn.to/3ivzMCK">Vortex Core</a> - a 40% keyboard from a Taiwanese company Vortex, makers of the ever popular <a href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=3633">Pok3r</a> keyboard (which I happen to use as my daily driver). This is a keyboard with only 47 keys: it drops the numpad (what&rsquo;s called 80%), function row (now we&rsquo;re down to 60%), and the dedicated number row (bringing us to the 40% keyboard realm).</p>

<p>Words don&rsquo;t do justice to how small a 40% keyboard is. So here is a picture of Vortex Core next to Pok3r, which is an already a small keyboard.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/vortex-core-and-pok3r.jpg" title="A picture of Vortex Core 40% keyboard next to a Pok3r 60% keyboard." ></p>

<p>At around a <a href="https://amzn.to/3ivzMCK">$100 on Amazon</a> it&rsquo;s one of the cheaper 40% options, but Vortex did not skimp on quality. The case is sturdy, is made of beautiful anodized aluminum, and has some weight to it. The keycaps this keyboard comes with feel fantastic (including slight dips on <code>F</code> and <code>J</code> keys), and I`m a huge fan of the look.</p>

<p>I hooked it up to my Microsoft Surface Go as a toy more than anything else. And now I think I may have discovered the perfect writing machine! Small form factor of the keyboard really compliments the already small Surface Go screen, and there&rsquo;s just enough screen real estate to comfortably write and edit text.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/vortex-core-and-surface-go.jpg" title="A picture of Vortex Core 40% keyboard plugged into Microsoft Surface Go screen." ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve used Vortex Core on and off for the past few days, and I feel like I have a solid feel for it. Let&rsquo;s dig in!</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s different about it?</h2>

<p>First, the keycap size and distance between keys are standard: it&rsquo;s a standard staggered layout most people are used to. This means that when typing words, there is no noticeable speed drop. In fact I find myself typing a tiny bit faster using this keyboard than my daily driver - but that could just be my enthusiasm shining through. I hover at around 80 words per minute on both keyboards.</p>

<p>That is until it&rsquo;s time to type &ldquo;you&rsquo;re&rdquo;, or use any punctuation outside of the <code>:;,.&lt;&gt;</code> symbols. That&rsquo;s right, the normally easily accessible apostrophe is hidden under the function layer (<code>Fn1 + b</code>), and so is the question mark (<code>Fn1 + Shift + Tab</code>). <code>-</code>, <code>=</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>\</code>, <code>[</code>, and <code>]</code> are gone too, and I&rsquo;ll cover those in due time.</p>

<p>On a first day this immediately dropped my typing speed to around 50 words per minute, as it&rsquo;s completely unintuitive at first! In fact, I just now stopped hitting <code>Enter</code> every time I tried to place an apostrophe! But only after a few hours of sparingly using Vortex Core I&rsquo;m up to 65 WPM, and it feels like I would regain my regular typing speed within a week.</p>

<p>Despite what you might think, it&rsquo;s relatively easy to get used to odd key placement like this.</p>

<p>Keys have 4 layers (not to be confused with programming layers), and that&rsquo;s how the numbers, symbols, and some of the more rarely used keys are accessed. For example, here&rsquo;s what the key <code>L</code> contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>Default layer (no modifiers): <code>L</code></li>
<li><code>Fn1</code> layer: <code>0</code></li>
<li><code>Fn1 + Shift</code> layer: <code>)</code></li>
<li><code>Fn</code> layer: <code>right arrow key</code></li>
</ul>


<p>The good news is that unlike many 40% keyboards on the market (and it&rsquo;s a rather esoteric market), Vortex Core has key inscriptions for each layer. Something like <a href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=3633https://olkb.com/collections/planck">Planck</a> would require you to print out layout cheatsheets while you get used to the function layers.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/vortex-core-left-half.jpg" title="Left side of the Vortex Core keyboard, demonstrating numbers and special characters." ></p>

<p>As I continue attempting to type, numbers always take me by surprise: the whole number row is a function layer on top of the home row (where your fingers normally rest). After initially hitting the empty air when attempting to type numbers, I began to get used to using the home row instead.</p>

<p>The placement mimics the order the keys would be in on the number row (<code>1234567890-=</code>), but <code>1</code> is placed on the <code>Tab</code> key, while <code>=</code> is on the <code>Enter</code>. While I was able to find the numbers relatively easily due to similar placement, I would often be off-by-one due to row starting on a <code>Tab</code> key.</p>

<p>Things get a lot more complicated when it comes to special symbols. These are already normally gated behind a <code>Shift</code>-press on a regular keyboard, and Vortex Core requires some Emacs-level gymnastics! E.g. you need to press <code>Fn1 + Shift + F</code> to conjure <code>%</code>.</p>

<p>Such complex keypresses are beyond counter-intuitive at first. Yet after a few hours, I began to get used to some of the more frequently used keys: <code>!</code> is <code>Fn1 + Shift + Tab</code>, <code>-</code> is <code>Fn1 + Shift + 1</code>, <code>$</code> (end of line in Vim) is <code>Fn1 + Shift + D</code>, and so on. Combining symbols quickly becomes problematic.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fairly easy to get used to inserting a lone symbol here and there, but the problems start when having to combine multiple symbols at once. E.g. writing an expression like <code>'Fn1 + Shift + D' = '$'</code> above involves the following keypresses: <code>&lt;Fn1&gt;&lt;Esc&gt; F N &lt;Fn1&gt;&lt;Tab&gt; &lt;Fn1&gt;&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Enter&gt; S H I F T &lt;Fn1&gt;&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;Enter&gt; D &lt;Fn1&gt;&lt;Esc&gt; &lt;Fn1&gt;&lt;Enter&gt; &lt;Fn1&gt;&lt;Esc&gt; &lt;Fn1&gt;&lt;Shift&gt;D &lt;Fn1&gt;&lt;Esc&gt;</code>. Could you image how long it took me to write that up?</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/vortex-core-right-half.jpg" title="Right side of the Vortex Core keyboard, demonstrating special characters placed on `bnm,.` keys." ></p>

<p>The most difficult part of getting used to the keyboard is the fact that a few keys on the right side are chopped off: <code>'/[]\</code> are placed in the bottom right of the keyboard, to <code>bnm,.</code> keys. While the rest of the layout attempts to mimic the existing convention and only shifting the rows down, the aforementioned keys are placed arbitrarily (as there&rsquo;s no logical way to place them otherwise).</p>

<p>This probably won&rsquo;t worry you if you don&rsquo;t write a lot of code or math, but I do, and it`s muscle memory I&rsquo;ll have to develop.</p>

<p>There are dedicated <code>Del</code> and <code>Backspace</code> keys, which is a bit of an odd choice, likely influenced by needing somewhere to place the <code>F12</code> key - function row is right above the home row, and is hidden behind the <code>Fn1</code> layer.</p>

<p>Spacebar is split into two (for ease of finding keycaps I hear), and it doesn&rsquo;t affect me whatsoever. I mostly hit spacebar with my left thumb and it&rsquo;s convenient.</p>

<p><code>Tab</code> is placed where the <code>Caps Lock</code> is, which feels like a good choice. After accidentally hitting <code>Esc</code> a few times, I got used to the position. Do make sure to get <a href="http://www.vortexgear.tw/vortex3.asp">latest firmware</a> for your Vortex Core - I believe earlier firmware versions hides Tab behind a function layer, defaulting the key to <code>Caps Lock</code> (although my keycaps reflected the updated firmware).</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;d say the numbers and the function row take the least amount of time to get used to. It&rsquo;s the special characters that take time.</p>

<h2>Can you use it with Vim?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Vim, and I even wrote <a href="https://amzn.to/3htsTjK">a book</a> on the subject. In fact, I&rsquo;m writing this very review in Vim.</p>

<p>And I must say, it&rsquo;s difficult. My productivity took a hit. I use curly braces to move between paragraphs, I regularly search with <code>/</code>, <code>?</code>, and <code>*</code>, move within a line with <code>_</code> and <code>$</code>, and use numbers in my commands like <code>c2w</code> (change two words) as well as other special characters, e.g. <code>da"</code> (delete around double quotes).</p>

<p>The most difficult combination being spelling correction: <code>z=</code> followed by a number to select the correct spelling. I consistency break the flow by having to press <code>Z &lt;Fn1&gt;&lt;Enter&gt; &lt;Fn1&gt;&lt;Tab&gt;</code> or something similar to quickly fix a misspelling.</p>

<p>My Vim productivity certainly took a massive hit. Yet, after a few days it&rsquo;s starting to slowly climb back up, and I find myself remembering the right key combinations as the muscle memory kicks in.</p>

<p>I assume my Vim experience translates well into programming. Even though I write code for a living, I haven&rsquo;t used Vortex Core to crank out code.</p>

<h2>Speaking of programming</h2>

<p>The whole keyboard is fully programmable (as long as you update it to the <a href="http://www.vortexgear.tw/vortex3.asp">latest firmware</a>).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an easy process - a <a href="http://www.vortexgear.tw/vortex3.asp">three page manual</a> covers everything that&rsquo;s needed like using different keyboard layers or remapping regular and function keys.</p>

<p>The manual also mentions using right <code>Win</code>, <code>Pn</code>, <code>Ctrl</code>, and <code>Shift</code> keys as arrow keys by hitting left <code>Win</code>, left <code>Alt</code>, and right spacebar. Vortex keyboards nowadays always come with this feature, but due to small form factor of the keys (especially Shift), impromptu arrow keys on Vortex Core are nearly indistinguishable from individual arrow keys.</p>

<p>Remapping is helpful, since I&rsquo;m used to having <code>Ctrl</code> where <code>Caps Lock</code> is (even though this means I have to hide Tab behind a function layer), or using <code>hjkl</code> as arrow keys (as opposed to the default <code>ijkl</code>).</p>

<p>It took me only a few minutes to adjust the keyboard to my needs, but I imagine I will come back for tweaks - I&rsquo;m not so sure if I&rsquo;ll be able to get used to special symbols hidden behind <code>Fn1</code> + <code>Shift</code> + key layer. Regularly pressing three keys at the time (with two of these keys being on the edge of the keyboard) feels unnatural and inconvenient right now. But I&rsquo;m only a few hours in, and stenographers manager to do it.</p>

<h2>Living in the command line</h2>

<p>The absence of certain special characters is especially felt when using the command line. Not having a forward slash available with a single keypress makes typing paths more difficult. I also use <code>Ctrl + \</code> as a modifier key for tmux, and as you could imagine it&rsquo;s just as problematic.</p>

<p>Despite so many difficulties, I&rsquo;m loving my time with Vortex Core! To be honest with myself, I don&rsquo;t buy new keyboards to be productive, or increase my typing speed. I buy them because they look great and are fun to type on. And Vortex Core looks fantastic, and being able to cover most of the keyboard with both hands is amazing.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s just something special about having such a small board under my fingertips.</p>

    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/one-page-ttrpg-prep/"/>
    <updated>2020-08-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/one-page-ttrpg-prep</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been running table top role playing games for over a decade on and off, and I&rsquo;ve settled into a prep routine. It&rsquo;s heavily borrowed, if not outright stolen from other GMs on the Internets, and I encourage you to steal and adapt what I&rsquo;m doing as well. If I had to guess, this way of preparation is stolen directly from the <a href="https://slyflourish.com/lazydm/">Lazy GM</a>&rsquo;s table.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned that in order to run a successful session, I need to prepare the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Discoveries: What my players need to discover.</li>
<li>Scenes: Where things happen.</li>
<li>Clues: Some thoughts on how to expose the discoveries.</li>
<li>Key NPCs: Some names and primary aspects of non player characters.</li>
<li>Enemies: A few stat blocks or references to enemies.</li>
</ul>


<p>And all of the above fits on a single page: I find it enough to run the session while providing player freedom without having to completely invent everything on the fly.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example for a Numenera game I ran a few weeks ago, where I adopted the idea behind the &ldquo;Mother Machine&rdquo; module from <a href="https://www.montecookgames.com/explorers-keys/">&ldquo;Explorer&rsquo;s Keys: Ten Instant Adventures for Numenera&rdquo;</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/ttrpg-game-prep.jpeg" title="A picture of a journal I use to prepare for tabletop role playing games." ></p>

<p>In this example, the village under players&#8217; protection is attacked by &ldquo;tarza&rdquo;, never before seen monsters. For historical reasons, my players are initially expected to blame a neighboring tribe of abhumans for the attack. The monsters are in fact part of a defense mechanism which is attempting to exterminate so-called &ldquo;cinomar&rdquo;: doppelgangers who are impersonating some of the villagers.</p>

<h2>Discoveries</h2>

<p>This section cover key information and plot twists, and it&rsquo;s the one I start with. I use it as a tool to outline the adventure, and it&rsquo;s helpful to refer to if I get stuck.</p>

<p>These are the details players should unravel throughout the session, and I usually check them off as the players find them. In fact, you&rsquo;ll see I check off most bullet points on the page as the session plays out.</p>

<p>Although, now that I&rsquo;m looking at the example I provided, the discoveries are not marked. I guess I&rsquo;m not very consistent.</p>

<h2>Scenes</h2>

<p>This is the primary tool I use during the game. Scenes outline encounters - be they social, exploratory, or combat related. Scenes help me form a general idea about locations the adventure will be taking a place in, as well as some of the key action sequences.</p>

<p>I often use scenes to help me control pacing: If I&rsquo;m running a 3 hour game with roughly 5 scenes planned, I know to hurry up if I haven&rsquo;t gotten to any of them at a one hour mark. It&rsquo;s often a good time to narrate a time skip, tie up an ongoing investigation, or suggest a direction for the party to move in.</p>

<p>Now this doesn&rsquo;t mean that the adventure is limited to these scenes. If (or more accurately &ldquo;when&rdquo;) the adventure goes off rails, I reskin these scenes or use them for an inspiration to quickly throw together a new scene.</p>

<h2>Clues</h2>

<p>Clues are ideas for how to surface discoveries. These are not strictly necessary if you&rsquo;re really creative, but if you&rsquo;re anything like me - these are a godsend.</p>

<p>Clues are concrete ways for players to discover plot points outlined in &ldquo;Discoveries&rdquo;. <em>&ldquo;The assassin had a letter signed by the big bad&rdquo;</em>, or <em>&ldquo;The drunken sailor lets slip about a cult in the town&rdquo;</em>. I aim for one clue per discovery, but it&rsquo;s not a hard rule.</p>

<p>The list should not be exhaustive, and should not be strictly followed - I treat this section as an exercise in creativity. I find it more impactful to try to come up with clues as I play &ndash; players often search in places I haven&rsquo;t thought of - so I place the clue to a discovery wherever the players are looking.</p>

<h2>Key NPCs</h2>

<p>This is a list of key non player characters relevant to the game. I try to keep number of named NPCs low to help my players remember them better, and I try to use as many recurring NPCs as humanly possible.</p>

<p>I usually add an aspect for each of the NPCs - a short description in a few words, something that makes them stand out in some way.</p>

<p>This list doesn&rsquo;t have to be exhaustive &ndash; you&rsquo;ll probably want to use the running list of NPCs for your campaign as a supplement for unexpected recurring characters, and a list of pre-generated names for unexpected encounters.</p>

<h2>Enemies</h2>

<p>The last thing is enemy stat blocks for quickly referencing if (again, &ldquo;when&rdquo;) a combat breaks out.</p>

<p>For Numenera, these are not particularly complex - most enemies are described by a single number and a few key things about them. I&rsquo;d imagine for D&amp;D and other combat focused systems you&rsquo;d want to put a bit more effort in making sure you&rsquo;re building balanced combat encounters, so that would warrant a section of its own.</p>

<p>I tend to spend a little under 20 minutes on all of the above, and I get to use it in three out of four games &ndash; the fourth one tends to go off the rails completely, and I&rsquo;m okay with it. Without investing as much time into prep, it&rsquo;s easy to be taken on a ride by the players.</p>

    <updated>2020-05-26T01:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/numenera-for-dnd-dms</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;ll be having our 12th Numenera game later this week, and ultimately Numenera proved to be easier to run compared to Dungeons and Dragons. I just wrote about <a href="https://www.rosipov.com/blog/numenera-for-dnd-players">teaching Numenera to my D&amp;D Players</a>, and it&rsquo;s worth sharing my own experience getting familiar with the system as a GM.</p>

<h2>Story is the king</h2>

<p>As a soft tabletop role playing system, Numenera focuses on storytelling over the rules. Every dozen pages or so the rulebook tirelessly reminds the reader: &ldquo;if rules get in the way of having fun or creating an interesting story, change them&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/numenera-and-dnd-books.jpg" title="Numenera rulebooks stacked next to Dungeons and Dragons rulebooks." ></p>

<p>Depending on your DMing style and party&rsquo;s needs you can get away with a lackluster D&amp;D story: even if the party is saving the world from the evil wizard for the umpteenth time, there are decently fun board game mechanics to fall back to. Monster Manual and Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide provide hundreds of fun creatures and straightforward rules for building balanced encounters, and there&rsquo;s plenty of clearly laid out tactical choices and fun abilities to play with in combat. Take out the story telling, and you&rsquo;ll have a pretty fun tactical game (isn&rsquo;t that what <a href="https://amzn.to/2zla2HW">Gloomhaven</a> did?).</p>

<p>But there really aren&rsquo;t enough rules in Numenera to make combat engaging without additional emotional investment from the players. This makes building something people care about paramount to having fun with Numenera. The usual storytelling rules apply: build a compelling story and let the players take you for a ride if their story is better (and it often is).</p>

<h2>You don&rsquo;t <em>need</em> combat encounters</h2>

<p>Numenera supports a breadth of combat options only limited by players&#8217; imagination, but many of them are not immediately obvious, and newer players will struggle to utilize the full spectrum of abilities available to them. Combat uses the same rules as the rest of the game, and is not more mechanically complicated (you decide what you want to do, you try to beat certain difficulty, you fail spectacularly).</p>

<p>Because of this combat is completely optional in Numenera. Don&rsquo;t force the players into combat if they find a way to avoid it. Make them feel great about their cunning victory! We&rsquo;ve had great and satisfying sessions without a single thrown punch.</p>

<p>That being said, it does not mean Numenera combat can&rsquo;t be fun. One of the most engaging sessions we had consisted of a single battle &ndash; when a monster hunter delve decided to hunt a morigo &ndash; an enormous beast whose entire purpose was to scare the players from entering an area. The fight was deadly and arduous, but the characters triumphed against all odds.</p>

<h2>You still need to know all the rules</h2>

<p>Latest edition of Numenera consists of two books, titled <a href="https://amzn.to/36FZvmV">Discovery</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2AbgeSx">Destiny</a> &ndash; both targeted at the game master. The two tomes combined clock in at a whopping 800 pages of reading material. However only 29 of the lavishly illustrated pages outline the rules. The rest provide supplemental material: character customization options, the setting, realizing the world, building compelling narrative, and so on.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/numenera-discovery-and-destiny.jpg" title="Numenera Discovery and Destiny core rulebooks." ></p>

<p>But because of this it&rsquo;s even more important for the GM to be intimately familiar with the rules. Since there was so little to learn, the group of players I&rsquo;m GMing for decided that it&rsquo;s not worth reading the rules. Thankfully Numenera rules are easy to teach, but you still need to know the rules.</p>

<h2>A lesson in assertiveness</h2>

<p>When playing D&amp;D, I&rsquo;d often outsource dealing with the rules by designating a rules arbiter from the player ranks. This doesn&rsquo;t seem to work in Numenera. There rules are guidelines, and logic dictates how each situation is resolved. GM has the fullest picture of the situation in their head, making it crucial for them to adjudicate.</p>

<p>It certainly took me time to get used to putting my foot down, even if the players might not always agree with the decision. I found myself frequently making snap judgements, and following up with any adjustments after the session &ndash; <a href="https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/numenera">rpg.stackexchange.com</a> turned out to be a great resource for asking questions about the spirit of the rules.</p>

<h2>Don&rsquo;t dungeon crawl</h2>

<p>&ldquo;And then you enter another room which contains X, Y, and Z&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s the line I kept repeating during our weakest session to date. Numenera does not land itself well to a typical dungeon crawl.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/numenera-rulebooks-stack.jpg" title="Numenera rulebooks stacked on top of each other." ></p>

<p>Monte Cook published a few sets of fantastic adventures which require little to no prep to run. <a href="https://amzn.to/2Adkdht">Weird Discoveries</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3gphdPE">Explorer&rsquo;s Keys</a> let you run adventures with minimal prep. But it doesn&rsquo;t help that these come with standard dungeon-style maps.</p>

<p>Turned out a more engaging way to describe locations is: &ldquo;Over the next few hours you explore the obelisk, and within the maze of the corridors you note a number of places of interest. There are&hellip;&rdquo;. The rulebook has my back on this too.</p>

<h2>Bring out the weird</h2>

<p>The most difficult part of running Numenera games was highlighting how weird the Ninth World truly is. My players kept falling back into thinking of Steadfast as a standard medieval fantasy setting, and that&rsquo;s in many ways because I kept forgetting to tell them how weird everything is.</p>

<p>How a mountain in the background is a machine from the prior world. How the water in the swamp was a conduit for some unimaginable device. And how none of it should make sense.</p>

<p>In earlier games, I had explanations ready for everything odd occurring in the world. I&rsquo;ve been slowly making an effort to make the world more mysterious, more unexplainable, and more weird. This seems to be the key to running a successful Numenera game, and I&rsquo;m still trying to find the balance between a consistent, but weird world characters live in.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before COVID-19 shelter-in-place order came to be, I played Dungeons and Dragons on and off for the past 10 or so years. I unfortunately don&rsquo;t have the patience to be a great player, but I enjoy running the game &ndash; being a Game Master constantly engages me, and I love seeing players have fun and overcome obstacles together.</p>

<p>Having to stay inside I had a prime opportunity to try something new, exciting, and less rule heavy than D&amp;D: that&rsquo;s how I discovered Numenera. Well, I&rsquo;ve been familiar with the concept for some time: I played Planescape: Torment &ndash; with Planescape being an inspiration for the setting of Numenera, and I&rsquo;ve recently completed Torment: Tides of Numenera &ndash; a spiritual successor to Planescape, which used the Cypher System rules&hellip; I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself, let me back up.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/numenera-keiran-yanner.jpg" title="Numenera game system, image property of Monte Cook games." ></p>

<p>Numenera is a science fantasy tabletop role-playing game set in the (oh so) distant future. The &ldquo;Cypher System&rdquo; is a tabletop game engine which Numenera runs on. The system is notorious for emphasizing storytelling over rules, and for usage of &ldquo;cyphers&rdquo; - a one time abilities meant to shake up gameplay. Want to teleport? You don&rsquo;t have to be a level 10 wizard to that. Find the right cypher, and you can teleport, but only once. This keeps gameplay from getting stale, and provides players with exciting abilities from the get-go.</p>

<p>For the past few months I&rsquo;ve been running Numenera campaign for a group of friends, and we&rsquo;ve had a blast so far! We&rsquo;ve been playing over Google Hangouts, without miniatures or services like Roll20: and the game held up well.</p>

<p>It took some time for players to get used to the differences between the systems &ndash; and some picked up the new mindset faster than others. Here are the key concepts one had to learn to get used to Numenera. This overview is not complete, but I think it helps.</p>

<h2>Numenera, cyphers, and artifacts</h2>

<p>Numenera is just a catch-all term for weird devices and phenomenon. Now you don&rsquo;t have to say &ldquo;that device and/or contraption&rdquo; and say &ldquo;numenera&rdquo; instead. You&rsquo;re welcome!</p>

<p>Cyphers are items that give characters fun and unique one-off powers. Cyphers are plentiful, and using them like they&rsquo;re going out of fashion is the key to having fun in Numenera. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Cypher System&rdquo; for this exact reason.</p>

<p>Artifacts are a lot more rare, and can be used multiple times (often requiring a die roll to check if they deplete).</p>

<h2>Actions, skills, assets, and effort</h2>

<p>Every task in Numenera has a difficulty rated on a scale from 0 to 10. Be it sprinting on the battlefield, picking a lock, convincing a city guard you&rsquo;re innocent, or hitting that guard on the back of her head with a club. 0 is a routine action, like you sitting right now and reading this, or maybe going over to the fridge to grab a beer. Difficulty 10 is getting the Israeli prime minister to abandon his post, fly over to wherever you live, and serve you that beer. Oh and you&rsquo;re in charge of Israel now too, your majesty.</p>

<p>Your GM will tell you the difficulty of the task.</p>

<p>The only die players use in Numenera is d20 - the trusty 20-sided die (and that&rsquo;s already a lie - in a few cases d6 is also used). Multiply difficulty by 3, and that&rsquo;s the number you&rsquo;ll have to reach with your d20 roll. Juggling is a difficulty 4 task. This means you&rsquo;ll have to roll 12 (4 * 3) or higher to succeed.</p>

<p>But what if I&rsquo;m an experienced juggler you say? I&rsquo;m glad you asked: you can be either trained or specialized in a skill, reducing the difficulty by 1 and 2 respectively. Juggling for someone who is specialized in juggling is a difficulty 2 (4 - 2) task. You can reduce difficulty by up to 2 levels using skills. There is no definitive list of skills in Numenera, and you can choose to be skilled in anything you want, be it mathematics, dancing, or magic tricks.</p>

<p>Are you juggling well balanced pins? That&rsquo;s an asset, further reducing the difficulty by 1. You can apply up to 2 levels of assets to reduce task difficulty. Just like with skills, there&rsquo;s no strict definition of what constitutes an asset. Be creative!</p>

<p>Finally, you can apply effort to a task. Expand effort, and the task becomes more manageable. Effort is limited by how advanced the character is, and starting characters can&rsquo;t apply more than 1 level of effort.</p>

<p>Hence, a specialized juggler (-2) juggling well balanced pins (-1) and applying effort (-1) reduces task difficulty from level 4 to 0, making it a trivial task &ndash; no need to roll to succeed!</p>

<h2>Stat pools, edge, and more about effort</h2>

<p>Characters have three primary stats - might, speed, and intellect. There&rsquo;s no health or other resources to track, but your stat pools do deplete. Did you get punched in the face? Deduct damage from your might pool. Exerted effort to concentrate on juggling? Pay the price through your speed pool. Trying to figure out how something works? Reduce your intellect pool.</p>

<p>You use the same resource to exert yourself and to take damage. As your pools deplete, your character becomes debilitated, and once all 3 pools drop to 0 - your character dies. There&rsquo;s nothing more to it.</p>

<p>The stat pools replenish by resting, and you can rest 4 times a day - for a few seconds, 10 minutes, 1 hour, and 10 hours. When you rest - restore 1d6 + tier (1 for beginning character) points spread across pools of your choice.</p>

<p>Each character also has &ldquo;edge&rdquo;. Edge is an affinity in a particular stat, and reduces all resource cost in that pool. If you have edge 2 in might, each time you expand that resource, you reduce the cost by 2. Bashing with your shield costs 1 might? That&rsquo;s dropped to 0 for you. Moving a tree blocking the road all by yourself will cost 5 might points? That&rsquo;s now dropped down to 3.</p>

<p>This becomes particularly relevant when applying effort. Applying effort makes tasks easier, but costs points from a stat pool. First level of effort costs 3 points, and any subsequent levels cost 2. Say if you&rsquo;re trying to climb a tree (difficulty 3) and want to expand 2 levels of effort to make the task easier. That would cost you 5 points from your might pool, and your edge 1 in might drops the cost to 4.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t overthink it for now.</p>

<h2>Tiers, experience, and GM intrusions</h2>

<p>Every Numenera character has a tier, which is akin to levels in D&amp;D. There are 6 tiers, with each more advanced than the last. However, unlike in Dungeons and Dragons, the tiers are not detrimental to character advancement: characters get just as much if not more utility from cyphers, artifacts, and the way they interact with the world.</p>

<p>Experience is given out by the Game Master for accomplishing narrative milestones. Experience is also given during GM intrusions, Cypher System&rsquo;s signature narrative mechanic. At any point throughout the session, GM introduces unexpected consequences for player actions: a rope snaps, poisoned villain has an antidote, or a previously hidden enemy attacks a passing player. Each time an intrusion happens, the affected player gets 2 experience points - 1 for themselves, and 1 to give away to another player.</p>

<p>GM intrusions allow to adjust the difficulty of the game and introduce fun challenges on the fly. Many GMs already do this in their games, but the Cypher System awards the players experience when this happens, associating unexpected events with positive stimulus.</p>

<p>In Numenera, experience points are a narrative currency, and a way for players to influence direction of the story. Experience is often counted in single digits, and can be spent in various ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 XP: re-roll a die, or resist GM intrusion</li>
<li>2 XP: gain a short term benefit, like learn a local dialect, or become trained in a narrowly applicable skill</li>
<li>3 XP: gain a long term benefit: make an ally, establish base of operations, or gain an artifact</li>
<li>4 XP: increase your pools, learn a skill, gain an edge, increase amount of effort you can expend, get an additional ability, improve pool recovery rolls, or reduce armor penalty</li>
</ul>


<p>Once you&rsquo;ve spent 4 XP to advance your character 4 times, you advance to the next tier. All of the above benefits are equally valuable for character progression - as a die re-roll at the right time, or an ally&rsquo;s help can make all the difference in a tough situation.</p>

<h2>A word about combat</h2>

<p>You might notice that I still haven&rsquo;t brought up combat. And that&rsquo;s because there aren&rsquo;t a lot of additional rules.</p>

<p>Just like in D&amp;D, there are rounds. Combat initiative is a speed task, and turns are taken with as much structure as the group would desire. There&rsquo;s often no need for precise turn order outside of who goes first &ndash; the players or the enemies.</p>

<p>Attacking is a task against GM-given difficulty. So is defending. Effort can be expanded to make hitting a target easier. Characters can expand effort to get +3 damage on their attacks per level of effort instead.</p>

<p>Distances are measured as immediate (up to 10 ft), short (up to 50 ft), long (up to 100 ft), and very long. Melee attacks happen within an immediate distance, traveling short distance takes an action, and traveling long distance within a round is a level 4 athletics task.</p>

<p>Combat-related tasks are only limited by imagination. You can distract your enemies, assist your comrades, or swing into battle on a rope yelling &ldquo;Huzzah&rdquo;!</p>

<h2>Special rolls - natural 1, 19, and 20</h2>

<p>To keep dice rolls exciting, Numenera extends the idea of critical success and critical failure.</p>

<p>Natural 1 allows for a free GM intrusion. Something unexpected happens, and you don&rsquo;t get any experience for it.</p>

<p>Natural 17 and 18 provide +1 and +2 damage respectively when attacking.</p>

<p>Natural 19 gives the player an opportunity to come up with a minor effect (or inflict +3 damage): some minor advantage which usually persists for a round. Maybe an enemy is knocked back, or a merchant impressed by your bartering skills gives you an extra discount.</p>

<p>Natural 20 provides the player with a major effect of their choice (or up the damage to +4). The cutthroats in a bar spill the location of their next heist, or a enemy gets stunned in battle.</p>

<h2>Stories, rules, and common sense</h2>

<p>Finally, Numenera and Cypher System are focused on telling great stories, and many rules are deliberately vague and are left up to GM&rsquo;s discretion. In Numenera, if you wonder if you can attempt some task &ndash; you most definitely can try, and good GM will help you fail in spectacular and most importantly entertaining ways.</p>

    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/adjusting-to-wfh/"/>
    <updated>2020-05-04T17:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/adjusting-to-wfh</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Like many, I moved to working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parts of California enacted shelter-in-place order back in March, and it&rsquo;s been over a month and a half since then. I briefly worked from home back in 2013 as a freelancer - and I really got the whole work/life balance thing wrong. So this time around I&rsquo;ve decided to approach remote work with a plan.</p>

<p>My day begins around 7 or 8 am, without too much deviation from schedule. I used to bike to work before the pandemic, and I try to head out for a 30 minute ride in a morning a few days a week. There aren&rsquo;t a lot of people out early, and I love starting my day with some light cardio.</p>

<p>I share breakfast and coffee with my partner, often while catching up on our favorite morning TV show. At the moment I&rsquo;m being educated on Avatar: The Last Airbender. Ugh, Azula!</p>

<p>Breakfast is followed by a calendar sync. We check if either of us have overlapping or sensitive meetings. That way we know which calls either of us needs to take in another room - and which are okay to have in our workspace. Both of our desks are in the living room, and we use <a href="https://amzn.to/3ferNbP">noise cancelling headphones</a> throughout the day to help with focus. During the day we convert our bedroom to an ad hoc conference room.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/wfh-setup.jpg" title="A picture of my work-from-home setup." ></p>

<p>By 9 am, I have my desk set up: I replace my personal laptop with its corporate-issued counterpart. An <a href="https://amzn.to/2SwMCpc">external webcam</a> helps with the image quality, and a dedicated <a href="https://amzn.to/2W0vREV">display</a>, keyboard (<a href="http://www.vortexgear.tw/vortex2_2.asp?kind=47&amp;kind2=220&amp;kind3=&amp;kind4=999">Vortex Pok3r</a> with <a href="https://drop.com/buy/91600">Matt3o Nerd DSA</a> key cap set), and a mouse (<a href="https://amzn.to/2SwNWbE">Glorious Model O-</a>) alleviate the cramped feeling I get when using a laptop.</p>

<p>Most importantly, I&rsquo;m showered, groomed, and dressed by this time. While working in whatever I slept in has worked well for occasional remote Fridays, it proved to be unsustainable for prolonged remote work. Whenever I wasn&rsquo;t dressed for work, I found myself slowly drifting towards the couch, and trading a laptop for my phone. In fact, some days I dress up even more than I used to when going to the office!</p>

<p>This is where the clear separation between home and work is established. I&rsquo;m fully dressed and have my workstation set up: it&rsquo;s work time!</p>

<p>I spend the next few hours busy with heads down work, usually working on a design, writing some code, or doing anything which requires concentration. Playing something like a <a href="https://rainycafe.com/">Rainy Cafe</a> in the background helps me stay in the zone.</p>

<p>Back in the office, 11 am used to be my workout time: a gym buddy of mine would consistency exercise at 11 am, and I adopted the habit of joining him over the past few years. I decided not to move the time slot: at 11 am I change into my workout clothes and exercise: 30 to 45 minutes of bodyweight exercises or online classes use up the remainder of my morning willpower. I&rsquo;m so glad there are thousands of YouTube videos to keep me company!</p>

<p>My partner and I alternate cooking, and the next hour or so is reserved for cooking, lunch together, and cleanup. Remember the noise cancelling headphones? We haven&rsquo;t heard (and often seen) each other since morning! Getting to share lunch daily has definitely been the highlight of staying at home for me.</p>

<p>After that - back to work: design reviews, meetings, busywork.</p>

<p>I wrap up around 5 pm, and make a point not to work past that. I swap out my work laptop for my own (even if I&rsquo;m not planning to use it), and stow it away for the night. Disassembling my setup paired with showering and changing into house clothes creates a solid dividing line between work and home.</p>

<p>Cooking dinner together and evening activities follow, but that&rsquo;s a story for another time. Stay healthy and productive!</p>

    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/how-i-use-vimwiki/"/>
    <updated>2019-06-24T01:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/how-i-use-vimwiki</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been <a href="https://www.rosipov.com/blog/personal-wiki-with-vimwiki/">using Vimwiki for 5 years</a>, on and off. There&rsquo;s a multi year gap in between, some entries are back to back for months on end, while some notes are quarters apart.</p>

<p>Over those 5 years I&rsquo;ve tried a few different lightweight personal wiki solutions, but kept coming back to Vimwiki due to my excessive familiarity with Vim and the simplicity of the underlying format (plain text FTW).</p>

<p>I used to store my Vimwiki in Dropbox, but after Dropbox imposed a three device free tier limit, I <a href="https://www.rosipov.com/blog/google-drive-on-linux-with-rclone/">migrated to Google Drive</a> for all my storage needs (and haven&rsquo;t looked back!). I&rsquo;m able to view my notes on any platform (including previewing the HTML pages on mobile).</p>

<p>I love seeing how other people organize their Wiki homepage, so it&rsquo;s only fair to share mine:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/vimwiki-homepage-screenshot.png" title="Screenshot of my wiki homepage." ></p>

<p>I use Vimwiki as a combination of a knowledge repository and a daily project/work journal (<code>&lt;Leader&gt;wi</code>). I love being able to interlink pages, and I find it extremely helpful to write entries journal-style, without having to think of a particular topic or a page to place my notes in.</p>

<p>Whenever I have a specific topic in mind, I create a page for it, or contribute to an existing page. If I don&rsquo;t - I create a diary entry (<code>&lt;Leader&gt;w&lt;Leader&gt;w</code>), and move any developed topics into their own pages.</p>

<p>I use folders (I keep wanting to call them namespaces) for disconnected topics which I don&rsquo;t usually connect with the rest of the wiki: like video games, financial research, and so on. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m getting enough value out of namespaces though, and I might revisit using those in the future: too many files in a single directory is not a problem since I don&rsquo;t interract with the files directly.</p>

<p>Most importantly, every once in a while I go back and revisit the organizational structure of the wiki: move pages into folders where needed (<code>:VimwikiRenameLink</code> makes this much less painful), add missing links for recently added but commonly mentioned topics (<code>:VimwikiSearch</code> helps here), and generally tidy up.</p>

<p>I use images liberally (<code>{{local:images/nyan.gif|Nyan.}}</code>), and I occasionally access the HTML version of the wiki (generated by running <code>:VimwikiAll2HTML</code>).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found useful to keep a running todo list with a set of things I need to accomplish for work or my projects, and I move those into corresponding diary pages once the tasks are ticked off.</p>

<p>At the end of each week I try to have a mini-retrospective to validate if my week was productive, and if there&rsquo;s anything I can do to improve upon what I&rsquo;m doing.</p>

<p>I also really like creating in-depth documentation on topics when researching something: the act of writing down and organizing information it helps me understand it better (that&rsquo;s why, for instance, I have a beefy &ldquo;financial/&rdquo; folder, with a ton of research into somewhat dry, but important topics - portfolio rebalancing, health and auto insurance, home ownership, and so on).</p>

<p>Incoherent rambling aside, I&rsquo;m hoping this post will spark some ideas about how to set up and use your own personal wiki.</p>

    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/google-drive-on-linux-with-rclone/"/>
    <updated>2019-06-23T07:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/google-drive-on-linux-with-rclone</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently Dropbox hit me with the <a href="https://help.dropbox.com/accounts-billing/settings-sign-in/computer-limit">following announcement</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Basic users have a three device limit as of March 2019.</p></blockquote>

<p>Being the &ldquo;basic&rdquo; user, and relying on Dropbox across multiple machines, I got unreasonably upset (&ldquo;How dare you deny me free access to your service?!&rdquo;) and started looking for a replacement.</p>

<p>I already store quite a lot of things in Google Drive, so it seemed like a no brainer: I migrated all my machines to Google Drive overnight. There was but only one problem: Google Drive has official clients for Windows and Mac, but there&rsquo;s nothing when it comes to Linux.</p>

<p>I found the Internets to be surprisingly sparse on the subject, and I had to try multiple solutions and spent more time than I&rsquo;d like researching options.</p>

<p>The best solution for me turned out to be <code>rclone</code>, which mounts Google Drive as a directory. It requires <code>rclone</code> service to be constantly running in order to access the data, which is a plus for me - I&rsquo;ve accidentally killed Dropbox daemon in the past and had to deal with conflicts in my files.</p>

<p>Install <code>rclone</code> (<a href="https://rclone.org/install/">instructions</a>):</p>

<pre><code>curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash
</code></pre>

<p>From then on, <a href="https://rclone.org/drive/">rclone website some documentation</a> when it comes to the setup. I found it somewhat difficult to parse, so here it is paraphrased:</p>

<p>Launch <code>rclone config</code> and follow the prompts:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>n) New remote</code></li>
<li><code>name&gt; remote</code></li>
<li>Type of storage to configure: <code>Google Drive</code></li>
<li>Leave <code>client_id&gt;</code> and <code>client_secret&gt;</code> blank</li>
<li>Scope: <code>1 \ Full access to all files</code></li>
<li>Leave <code>root_folder_id&gt;</code> and <code>service_account_file&gt;</code> blank</li>
<li>Use auto config? <code>y</code></li>
<li>Configure this as a team drive? <code>n</code></li>
<li>Is this OK? <code>y</code></li>
</ul>


<p>From here on, you can interact with your Google Drive by running <code>rclone</code> commands (e.g. <code>rclone ls remote:</code> to list top level files). But I am more interested in a continuous running service and <code>mount</code> is what I need:</p>

<pre><code>rclone mount remote: $HOME/Drive
</code></pre>

<p>Now my Google Drive is accessible at <code>~/Drive</code>. All that&rsquo;s left is to make sure the directory is mounted on startup.</p>

<p>For Ubuntu/Debian, I added the following line to <code>/etc/rc.local</code> (before <code>exit 0</code>, and you need <code>sudo</code> access to edit the file):</p>

<pre><code>rclone mount remote: $HOME/Drive
</code></pre>

<p>For my i3 setup, all I needed was to add the following to <code>~/.config/i3/config</code>:</p>

<pre><code>exec rclone mount remote: $HOME/Drive
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s been working without an issue for a couple of weeks now - and my migration from Dropbox turned out to be somewhat painless and quick.</p>

    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/sane-vim-defaults-from-neovim/"/>
    <updated>2018-12-27T23:28:37+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/sane-vim-defaults-from-neovim</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Vim comes with a set of often outdated and counter-intuitive defaults. Vim has been around for around 30 years, and it only makes sense that many defaults did not age well.</p>

<p>Neovim addresses this issue by being shipped with many default options tweaked for modern editing experience. If you can&rsquo;t or don&rsquo;t want to use Neovim - I highly recommend setting some these defaults in your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if !has('nvim')
  set nocompatible
  syntax on

  set autoindent
  set autoread
  set backspace=indent,eol,start
  set belloff=all
  set complete-=i
  set display=lastline
  set formatoptions=tcqj
  set history=10000
  set incsearch
  set laststatus=2
  set ruler
  set sessionoptions-=options
  set showcmd
  set sidescroll=1
  set smarttab
  set ttimeoutlen=50
  set ttyfast
  set viminfo+=!
  set wildmenu
endif
</code></pre>

<p>The defaults above enable some of the nicer editor features, like <code>autoindent</code> (respecting existing indentation), <code>incsearch</code> (search as you type), or <code>wildmenu</code> (enhanced command-line completion). The defaults also smooth out some historical artifacts, like unintuitive backspace behavior. Keep in mind, this breaks compatibility with some older Vim versions (but it&rsquo;s unlikely to be a problem for most if not all users).</p>

    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/status-bar-color-in-vim-terminal-mode/"/>
    <updated>2018-12-26T21:02:24+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/status-bar-color-in-vim-terminal-mode</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re using a custom color scheme (why wouldn&rsquo;t you?) in conjunction with a terminal mode in Vim (again, why wouldn&rsquo;t you?), you may have noticed that the terminal status bar has no respect for your color scheme.</p>

<p>Run <code>:term</code>, and you&rsquo;ll be greeted to the default status bar:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/vim-terminal-mode-default-colors.png" title="Screenshot of the default terminal mode status line." ></p>

<p>Since terminal mode is still in beta in Vim 8.1, we have to manually set the highlighting groups. It&rsquo;ll require a bit of digging.</p>

<p>Navigate to the directory containing your current color scheme. Depending on the plugin manager, the color schemes are located in different places. On Linux, default color schemes often live in <code>/usr/share/vim/vimcurrent/colors</code>. In this example, I&rsquo;m using PaperColor scheme, and I have it installed using vim-plug in <code>~/.vim/plugged/papercolor-theme</code>, and <code>colors/PaperColor.vim</code> is the file we&rsquo;re looking for.</p>

<p>Search for <code>StatusLine</code> and <code>StatusLineNC</code> (tip: you can do a whole word search in Vim by running <code>/\&lt;StatusLine\&gt;</code>), and note the values used (you might have to jump through a few variables if the color scheme author decided to be fancy). You&rsquo;re interested in <code>ctermbg</code>, <code>ctermfg</code>, <code>guibg</code>, and <code>guifg</code>.</p>

<p>You might find something like this:</p>

<pre><code>hi StatusLine ctermbg=24 ctermfg=254 guibg=#004f87 guifg=#e4e4e4
hi StatusLineNC ctermbg=252 ctermfg=238 guibg=#d0d0d0 guifg=#444444
</code></pre>

<p>Copy those lines to your <code>~/.vimrc</code>. Change <code>StatusLine</code> to <code>StatusLineTerm</code>, and change <code>StatusLineNC</code> to <code>StatusLineTermNC</code>:</p>

<pre><code>" Manually set the status line color.
hi StatusLineTerm ctermbg=24 ctermfg=254 guibg=#004f87 guifg=#e4e4e4
hi StatusLineTermNC ctermbg=252 ctermfg=238 guibg=#d0d0d0 guifg=#444444
</code></pre>

<p>Reload <code>~/.vimrc</code> (<code>:w | so %</code>), and the terminal mode status line should have the same colors as your color scheme:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/vim-terminal-mode-correct-colors.png" title="Screenshot of the terminal mode status line with corrected colors." ></p>

<p>Above, <code>hi</code> is a shorthand for <code>highlight</code>, which is used to define highlight group colors. <code>StatusLineTerm</code> and <code>StatusLineTermNC</code> define the highlight groups for terminal mode status line (in active and inactive windows respectively). Options <code>ctermbg</code> and <code>guibg</code> define the background color, and <code>ctermfg</code> and <code>guifg</code> are responsible for the foreground (text) color.</p>

    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/my-book-has-been-published</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past six to nine months I&rsquo;ve been working on a book - <a href="https://amzn.to/2EfGaN5">Mastering Vim</a>. Mastering Vim is a passion project which is meant to take the reader (you) from zero to a hero (future you): from knowing nothing about Vim, to becoming a power user. I cover many of Vim&rsquo;s mysterious commands, philosophy behind the beloved editor, configuration tips, a plethora of community created plugins, as well as creating your own plugins.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/mastering-vim.png" title="A picture of a &#34;Mastering Vim&#34; cover." alt="A picture of a &#34;Mastering Vim&#34; cover."></p>

<p>Mastering Vim was written with support from Packt Publishing and was kindly reviewed by Bram Moolenaar (<a href="https://moolenaar.net">website</a>) - the creator of Vim. Many people made this book possible, including <a href="https://vimconf.org">VimConf Japan</a> crew, who kindly hosted me earlier this year. Thank you to everyone for making Mastering Vim happen!</p>

<p>Give it a read and let me know what you think, <a href="https://amzn.to/2EfGaN5">Mastering Vim is available on Amazon</a>!</p>

<p>P.S: This post, like many others, is written in Vim.</p>

    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/cross-platform-vim-plug-setup</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve recently switch to <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">vim-plug</a>, a lightweight Vim plugin manager.</p>

<p>It comes with a little <code>.vimrc</code> snippet which downloads the plugin, but it only works for Unix. I use Vim across all three platforms regularly, so I updated the snippet:</p>

<pre><code>" Download and install vim-plug (cross platform).
if empty(glob(
    \ '$HOME/' . (has('win32') ? 'vimfiles' : '.vim') . '/autoload/plug.vim'))
  execute '!curl -fLo ' .
    \ (has('win32') ? '\%USERPROFILE\%/vimfiles' : '$HOME/.vim') . 
    \ '/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs ' .
    \ 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim'
  autocmd VimEnter * PlugInstall --sync | source $MYVIMRC
endif
</code></pre>

<p>The above should work across all three major OSes, since Windows 10 recently received <code>curl</code> support.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past few years I&rsquo;ve been trying to focus on having more mindful experiences in my life. I find it rewarding to be present in the moment, without my thoughts rushing onto whatever awaits me next.</p>

<p>I present to you the biggest distraction: my phone.</p>

<p>I use to get in touch with people I love. I&rsquo;m more productive at work because I have access to information on the go. I also use my phone to browse Reddit, YouTube, and every other media outlet imaginable. Even worse, sometimes I just waste time tinkering with the settings or mindlessly browsing through the apps I have installed.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an attention sink.</p>

<p>Nearly a year ago as I was browsing the Google Play Store I bumped into a new launcher: KISS. The tag line caught my attention: &ldquo;Keep It Simple, Stupid&rdquo;. I went ahead and downloaded the launcher. I haven&rsquo;t changed to another launcher since.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how my home screen looks today:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/kiss-launcher-home-screen.png" title="A screenshot of a KISS launcher home screen." ></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing besides a single search bar. The search bar takes me to the apps I need, web searches I&rsquo;m interested in, or people I&rsquo;m trying to reach out to.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s simple to use. Start typing an app or a contact name, and the results show up above the search bar:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/kiss-launcher-search-results.png" title="A screenshot of searching for an app with a KISS launcher." ></p>

<p>This simple concept has been responsible for cutting hours upon hours from my phone usage. Opening an app becomes a more deliberate experience, I open my phone with a purpose (granted this purpose might be to kill hours looking at cat videos). There&rsquo;s no more scrolling through everything I have installed just to find something to stimulate my attention for a few more seconds.</p>

<p>You can download the KISS Launcher for Android from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.neamar.kiss">Google Play Store</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/making-a-packing-spreadsheet/"/>
    <updated>2018-03-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/making-a-packing-spreadsheet</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Being the unique person I am, I love traveling. Oftentimes I end up getting deep into trying to optimize my packing methods. There are dozens of tools online designed to help with this exact thing (services like <a href="http://lighterpack.com">Lighterpack</a> or <a href="http://geargrams.com">GearGrams</a>). But, being handy with code, I decided to dabble in the subject on my own.</p>

<p>One of the most important things in packing is the overall weight of the pack, and I always want to know what type of things are the heaviest. I also want to be able to run random queries on my data, whatever it is that I&rsquo;m trying to learn. I want to have an inventory of items (backpacks, clothes, storage solutions) which I can plug in and out of a spreadsheet to see how the resulting picture changes on the go. Working with software as my day job, I’d also like for the solution to be automated whenever possible.</p>

<p>Google Spreadsheets turned out to be the perfect solution, providing the ability to quickly sum up the weight of my things and output insights about the data.</p>

<h2>Final Result</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qDhMoVmmTroM-eN0MZIU2PzE5YucsyPhbuPZPDGhemM/edit#">link to the spreadsheet</a>, I encourage the reader to copy and play around with in anyway you see fit.</p>

<p>Here’s the final result for a multi-day trip I will have for this year. As you can see, my pack weighs around 3 kilograms or a bit over 6 freedom units (not including water). My recently purchased Nintendo Switch is the heaviest item (and it’s worth every gram as it makes flying tolerable), but clothes take up most of the weight:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/packing-spreadsheet.png" title="A screenshot of a packing spreadsheet." ></p>

<p>I use indentation levels to show that some items are contained within other items. This also lets me calculate the absolute and relative weights of a whole container with everything inside of it (see fields labeled “Container” and “Percentage”).</p>

<p>The “Weight” and the “Breakdown” fields indicate absolute and relative item weight respectively, which accounts for quantity of the item (quantity defaults to 1 if not explicitly set). Weight-related fields are color coded from lightest items in green to heaviest items in red.</p>

<p>Categories are used to group items and execute queries on the data and learn insights like these:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/packing-spreadsheet-weight-chart.png" title="A chart representing the weight of each category of items relative to a weight of the whole pack." ></p>

<p>There’s a separate sheet where I enter item names, categories, and weights, which I then use to automatically populate values above and autofill item names in the primary sheet:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/packing-spreadsheet-inventory.png" title="A screenshot of an inventory tab of the packing spreadsheet." ></p>

<h2>The Technical Details</h2>

<p>I haven’t worked with Google Spreadsheets (or Excel for that matter) a lot in the past, but with an access to clear documentation (and a hundred of web searches later) it was straightforward to get the hang of the it.</p>

<p>I started off by manually populating the final result sheet, manually adjusting formulas for Container/Percentage cells, as I had no idea how I would detect the indentation yet. I like when things look pretty, so I applied conditional formatting rules right away, and the looks of the sheet really haven’t changed throughout the process.</p>

<p>Next, I created an inventory sheet, which I wanted to use as a source of data in the resulting sheet. A few Google searches and some trial &amp; error resulted in a lookup formula:</p>

<pre><code>=ArrayFormula(
 IF(
   NOT(ISBLANK($B2)),
   INDEX(InventoryCategories, MATCH($B2, InventoryItems, 0)),
   IF(
     NOT(ISBLANK($C2)),
     INDEX(InventoryCategories, MATCH($C2, InventoryItems, 0)),
     INDEX(InventoryCategories, MATCH($D2, InventoryItems, 0))
   )
  )
)
</code></pre>

<p><code>ArrayFormula</code> is necessary in order to create arrays on the fly without printing intermediate results in the spreadsheet. <code>InventoryItems</code> and <code>InventoryCategories</code> are named ranges referring to item names and categories in the inventory sheet. <code>MATCH</code> finds an index of a first occurrence of the item name in the sheet, and retrieves corresponding category name. An item weight is retrieved by the exact same principle.</p>

<p>Trying to find the container weight took a lot more time, and resulted in a lot more headache. Solution for handling indentation in Google Spreadsheets wasn’t as elegant as I would have hoped for, but it got the job done:</p>

<pre><code>=ArrayFormula(
     SUM(
       $I2:INDIRECT(
         CONCATENATE(
           "$I",
           ROW() + IF(
             NOT(ISBLANK($B2)),
             MATCH(FALSE, ISBLANK($B3:$B), 0),
             MATCH(FALSE, ISBLANK($C3:$C), 0)
           ) - 1
         )
       )
     )
</code></pre>

<p>The formula above finds the first non-empty cell in a column. It starts searching from the next row (for example, for an item on a second row, we look at the third row and below). After it knows which row first non-empty cell is in, the formula turns it into a string (column $I contains item weights) and use it as an upper bound of a sum of the weights. Finished formula is a bit longer (it adds sugar to only display the number when needed), and if you’re interested - you can look it up in the spreadsheet.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/packing-spreadsheet-indentation.png" title="A screenshot used for explaining indentation logic." ></p>

<p>For example, in the screenshot above, the formula will start looking at cells in a column right after the &ldquo;Packing cube&rdquo;. As soon as it finds a non-empty cell (&ldquo;Nintendo Switch case&rdquo;), the formula will determine this row to be an upper boundary. The formula then will sum weights starting with a &ldquo;Packing cube&rdquo; row, and up to but not including &ldquo;Nintendo Switch case&rdquo; row.</p>

<p>The rest involved many small tweaks, adding pretty colors, hiding N/A errors and zeroes, and trying to find the perfect shade for column borders.</p>

<p>And, since you made it this far, here’s how the numbers above look in the real world:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/cleveland-trip-backpack-on-off.png" title="Side by side pictures of a packed backpack: open and closed." ></p>

<p>Hopefully you found this useful, or at least somewhat entertaining. There’s a lot of room for improvement, and I aimed to provide a framework and a few basic ideas for building a spreadsheet to accommodate one’s twisted ultralight needs.</p>

    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/automating-octopress-publishing/"/>
    <updated>2017-11-14T15:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/automating-octopress-publishing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I really like Octopress. It builds on top of Jekyll to address certain rough edges, and provides ready to go lighting fast blogging platform. It&rsquo;s easily extendible if you know how to code (thanks to a rather clean and well organized code base), and posts are just plain Markdown files.</p>

<p>One issue though - I need to be near a computer to publish and preview the article. This becomes difficult if I&rsquo;m traveling with, say, a tablet.</p>

<p>I have a low end AWS Lightsail instance I use for writing and publishing, but it&rsquo;s not always fun to write when SSHing into a server, and I often write offline - making it even more difficult to move files between where I write and where I publish. And managing images is a nightmare. To resolve this, I set up a few directories I use in Dropbox, and wrote a few scripts to move things around when needed.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a directory structure in Dropbox:</p>

<pre><code>- blog/
  - posts/
    - 2017-11-20-automatic-octopress-publishing.markdown
  - img/
    - input/
      - a-picture-of-a-flower.jpg
    - output/
</code></pre>

<p>I put Markdown files in <code>Dropbox/blog/posts/</code> (and numerous offline editors sync with Dropbox - I&rsquo;m writing this with <a href="https://stackedit.io/app">StackEdit</a>, and I use <a href="https://ia.net/writer/">iA Writer</a> on my tablet). I add my images to <code>Dropbox/img/input/</code>. I  tend to strip metadata from my images and resize them to fit the maximum page width (I don&rsquo;t really care for high resolution pictures, speed is preferred over ability to zoom into a picture). For this, two tools are needed:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install imagemagick exiftool
</code></pre>

<p>When I&rsquo;m done writing or want to preview an article, I SSH into my AWS Lightsail instance and run <code>sync.sh</code>, a small script which moves posts to a proper directory, processes images and places them in the desired location, as well as starts Octopress instance (this way I can preview my blog on the AWS Lightsail instance). Contents of <code>sync.sh</code> (don&rsquo;t forget to <code>chmod +x</code>):</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
cd $HOME/Dropbox/blog/img/input
mogrify -resize 832x620 -quality 100 -path $HOME/Dropbox/blog/img/output *.jpg
exiftool -all= $HOME/Dropbox/blog/img/output/*.jpg
cp $HOME/Dropbox/blog/posts/*.markdown $HOME/blog/source/_posts
cp $HOME/Dropbox/blog/img/output/*.jpg $HOME/blog/source/images/posts
cd $HOME/blog
rake generate
rake preview
</code></pre>

<p>I run the above script every time I want to preview the site. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s easy to set up a daemon to watch for changes in the Dropbox folders, but I don&rsquo;t see the need for that yet. Also, I just statically resize images to a particular resolution (832x620) since all of the pictures I upload have the same aspect ratio, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a way to calculate that number on the fly for this script to work with different aspect ratios.</p>

<p>Lastly, when I deployed and committed my changes (still commit and deploy manually out of a habit), I run <code>archive.sh</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
mv $HOME/Dropbox/blog/posts/*.markdown $HOME/Dropbox/blog/published
rm $HOME/Dropbox/blog/img/input/*
rm $HOME/Dropbox/blog/img/output/*
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s not much, but enough to save some manual labor involved in publishing to Octopress.</p>

    <link href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/a-trip-to-salt-lake-city/"/>
    <updated>2017-11-13T15:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/a-trip-to-salt-lake-city</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This article is a collaboration between my partner and I.</em></p>

<p>Since moving into a studio, I have missed the freedom of taking off randomly, getting to know a different city or state and overall not being tied down to a routine or a location. I love the idea of trivializing travel, so it was only natural to have a random trip at the end of the week.</p>

<p>My partner watches <a href="http://www.thebucketlistfamily.com/">The Bucket List Family</a> on a weekly basis and caught the traveling bug as well. Unfortunately, we are not yet at the level where we can afford a 5 star trip to international locals or have companies pay for our travels (one day!). Our goal was to spend a few days going out of state to break the work week and avoid living for the weekend.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-ready-for-trip-to-slc.jpg" title="Ready for the trip to Salt Lake City." ></p>

<p>We decided to leave Northern California on Thursday afternoon for Salt Lake City, Utah as soon as we were done with work. Roughly 800 miles each way, if one counts exits and driving around sightseeing. Inspired by an acquaintance who travels the world with a folding bike, my partner and we took our bikes with us: a borrowed Brompton folding bike for my partner in the back seat, and my <a href="http://amzn.to/2xT6xT7">ZycleFix Prime</a> mounted on the rack in the rear.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/brompton-bike-in-the-backseat.jpg" title="Brompton bike in the backseat." ></p>

<p>Driving through California, Nevada, and Utah on I-80 was always one of my favorites - and it was nice to share the wonders of the world with my partner. She clocked in a lot more international travel than I did, but only been to a handful of states. It was her first time in Utah and each stop on the way to the Salt Flats exposed us to all kinds of people, different from the type of individuals we typically see inside the Silicon Valley tech bubble. We saw people with different lives, habits, hobbies, and worldviews, which to be perfectly honest, was refreshing.</p>

<p>Throughout the trip, we made it a point not to make any plans and go with the flow &ndash; be it our driving pace, entertainment or food options, or cities we decided to stay the night in. Traveling that way removed the stress associated with finding the perfect location and planning a fun trip. Don’t like the town we stopped at? Let’s keep driving. Enjoy a specific city? Let’s spend the night there. Having issues at a hotel? Back on the road we go.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/beautiful-sky-on-our-way.jpg" title="Beautiful sky as we’re driving on I-80." ></p>

<p>We found a hotel while driving on the I-80 and settled there for the night. Unfortunately the place did not have a strong enough WiFi, which led us to drive to the next town over for coffee and internet to work remotely. We ended up spending 6 hours in the coffee shop making sure that we kept ourselves well caffeinated and the servers well tipped. After a somewhat productive day, we decided to explore the city’s downtown and save the Salt Flats drive for the daytime.</p>

<p>Our Super 8 Motel in Wendover cost us around $70 for the night and was more comfortable than expected. We ended up passing out as soon as we got to the room, exhausted from the day. We tried to stay at cheaper hotels/motels, while avoiding shady looking places. We would most often pick the 2nd or 3rd cheapest option. We never stayed in one place for more than a night and lucked out every time we got ourselves a room. Every room we slept in was clean and we even managed to squeeze in a daily workout before the start of each day.</p>

<p>Keeping a healthy diet on the other hand was a whole other challenge. Between cafes, restaurants and late night cravings, we failed at maintaining proper eating habits and saving on food. We spent around $300 on food alone. Eating is definitely one area for improvement, especially as we decide to travel more. Dieting is hard and dieting on the road is even harder.</p>

<p>On Saturday, we finally headed to Utah and stopped at a rest stop by the Salt Flats. The view was marvelous and cold for an October day. We left the Salt Flats for a mall, City Creek Center, in Salt Lake City where we had another amazingly delicious and unhealthy lunch. To feel better about our life choices, we used our bikes to get some cardio and discover the city on two-wheels. We biked through Memory Grove Park, crashed a wedding, and biked almost to the Capitol. Almost. Due to Salt Lake’s incredible, deadly hills. Next time, SLC, next time we shall conquer you.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/salt-flats-are-gorgeous.jpg" title="Beautiful Salt Flats." ></p>

<p>After a day of biking and testing each other&rsquo;s patience, we decided to go for a date night and talk through our attempts at making life on the road work. Traveling solo is a very different experience than traveling with a partner. We chatted over Brazilian BBQ, another unhealthy choice, and agreed that we needed to include time alone as part of our travel routine and constantly check in with each other.</p>

<p>We headed to the hotel and decided to leave back for California after breakfast on Sunday. Oh, and on the topic of car, the subject of staying in the Prius or camping came up a few times. We even prepared our tents in that event but the cold weather and the thought of a hot shower took priority&hellip; Oh well, hotel Prius will get more use some other time.</p>

<p>In one day, we drove from Utah back to Northern California. We have different memories of the road back. For her, it was long and slow. For me as a driver, it passed within a blink of an eye. Overall, our trip to Utah was a success and we learned a lot:</p>

<ol>
<li>Nothing can replace the freedom associated with the absence of a plan. When there&rsquo;s no agenda or times to be at specific places - you&rsquo;re never late, never in a hurry, and you&rsquo;ve always seen more than you planned for. It allowed us to be surprised and delighted by places we encountered without imposing our pace on said locations.</li>
<li>Taking time for oneself is a necessity when traveling with someone else. Time alone does not always mean actually being alone. It can be whatever works for you as a couple. For us, it’s spending time on our devices while sitting next to each other.</li>
<li>Approaching each location with an open mind. You are not always going to get to travel to exotic <a href="http://www.rosipov.com/blog/him-and-her-whats-inside-the-bag/">places like the Bahamas</a>, but the opportunity to fall in love with a place or its people is always there.</li>
</ol>

    <updated>2017-10-15T15:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/him-and-her-whats-inside-the-bag</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Living in a car for nearly a year made me pick up number of travel-related skills, here and there. Having limited available space forced &ldquo;less is more&rdquo; philosophy on me, and it&rsquo;s something I carried over into more stationary life. Right now I&rsquo;m taking a break from car dwelling and living in a small apartment in Bay Area. It didn&rsquo;t stop my love for travel though, as I&rsquo;m writing this entry on my flight to Nassau, Bahamas. 5 days at the destination, leisure. One of the many weekends I&rsquo;m not home.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/two-backpacks-on-a-bed.jpg" title="Both of our backpacks, bigger is hers." ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not traveling alone this time, and my traveling partner has a similar outlook on travel.</p>

<h2>Him</h2>

<p>Less is more. Every trip starts with packing. I use my <a href="http://amzn.to/2xHIV2F">eBags Motherlode Weekender backpack</a>, which is about the perfect size for me when it&rsquo;s compressed tightly. I can probably fit in double the stuff I packed in the backpack, but I love having room in case I pick something up at the destination.</p>

<p>I never have to check in my bag, and it&rsquo;s light enough to carry on my back without any strain. I can explore my destination as soon as I arrive, without the need to find arrangement for my bags.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/his-opened-backpack.jpg" title="My backpack, open." ></p>

<p>I pack minimally, only having two-three sets of each type of clothing. I hand-wash the clothes I wear before I go to bed. I cycle through a total of 3 pairs of undergarments - most dry overnight as I sleep.</p>

<p>Furthermore, all my outfits can be mixed and matched together, so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about pairing tops, bottoms, and shoes. I like to think I have some sense of style to, for those wondering. Most people I meet won&rsquo;t likely see me for more then one-two days in a row, and those who do are not likely to pay attention to my small wardrobe - as long as it looks clean and sharp.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what the clothing items for this trip look like:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/his-stuff-inside-the-backpack.jpg" title="Clothing items inside the backpack." ></p>

<ul>
<li>Business-casual dress-shirt.</li>
<li>Two T-shirts.</li>
<li>Pair of shorts.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2zpE3Bf">Icebreaker merino underwear</a>, 2 pairs.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2xHk92J">Darn Tough socks</a>, 2 pairs.</li>
<li>Jacket.</li>
<li>Swimming trunks.</li>
<li>Travel towel, for the beach.</li>
<li>Flip flops.</li>
<li>Workout outfit:

<ul>
<li>Tank top.</li>
<li>Shorts.</li>
<li>Sports underwear.</li>
<li>Running sneakers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>All of the above is contained within a single <a href="http://amzn.to/2yLgwxz">packing cube</a> and a travel shoe bag.</p>

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t sound like a lot, but it&rsquo;s plenty (add the outfit I&rsquo;m wearing on the plane - pants, T-shirt, sweater, shoes, pair of underwear, socks). The above lets me have outfits for all kinds of events, activities, and anticipated weather at the destination.</p>

<p>My personal hygiene stuff fits in a dettachable bag which comes with the backpack. Not much special here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Toothbrushes.</li>
<li>Toothpaste.</li>
<li>Floss.</li>
<li>Deodorant.</li>
<li>Hairbrush.</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/2zrcN5t">Quick dry scrub net</a>.</li>
<li>Contact lenses.</li>
</ul>


<p>For entertainment and downtime I have my trusty Google Pixel C (with attached keyboard) and a pair of cheap apple ear buds. Bonus point for USB C standard - I only need to use a single charger for my tablet and a phone.</p>

<h2>Her</h2>

<p>Traveling with a space obsessed partner <em>(him: Hey!)</em> has forced me to look at packing in a different way. I first experimented with the idea of minimalism after watching The BucketList Family and avoiding airline fees is always a bonus. With every trips, I refined my set up. While I am not as lightweight and nimble as my partner, I have made significant improvements to my travel routine and picked up a few tips and tricks from him.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/her-opened-backpack.jpg" title="Her backpack, open." ></p>

<p>For example, the <a href="http://amzn.to/2zbhUG2">eBag Weekender</a> was my first real travel purchase, which I made sure to always have ready for use, meaning that it&rsquo;s always stocked with toiletries, travel documents and packing cubes. Given my propensity for sweating, I upgraded to a <a href="http://amzn.to/2yLgwxz">clean/dirty packing cube</a> and a <a href="http://amzn.to/2hJibsQ">charcoal odor remover</a> for my workout outfit.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/her-packing-cubes.jpg" title="Her packing cubes in a backpack." ></p>

<p>For this trip, this is what is inside my bag including the clothes I am wearing to travel:</p>

<p>On me:</p>

<ul>
<li>A tank top.</li>
<li>A hoodie.</li>
<li>A denim jacket.</li>
<li>Lululemon leggings.</li>
<li>Bra and underwear.</li>
<li>Sandals</li>
</ul>


<p>In my luggage:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/her-stuff-inside-the-backpack.jpg" title="What's in her luggage." ></p>

<ul>
<li>Button on shirt.</li>
<li>Tank top.</li>
<li>T-shirt.</li>
<li>Pair of pants.</li>
<li>Pair of shorts.</li>
<li>Rain jacket.</li>
<li>5 pairs of underwear (one is never too prepared in terms of underwear, and this is where I refuse to become a minimalist).</li>
<li>Workout oufit:

<ul>
<li>Leggings.</li>
<li>Dry fit T-shirt.</li>
<li>One pair of socks.</li>
<li>Workout bra.</li>
<li>Sports sneakers.</li>
<li>Bikini</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Toiletries:</p>

<ul>
<li>Foundation.</li>
<li>Makeup brush.</li>
<li>Travel-friendly lotion.</li>
<li>Natural oil for face washing purposes.</li>
<li>Feminine hygiene soap</li>
<li>Ingrown hair serum.</li>
<li>L&#8217;Instant de Guerlain perfume (while the current bottle takes a lot of space and adds weight, I have yet to find a travel friendly way to carry it).</li>
</ul>


<p>If you haven&rsquo;t noticed, my backpack is bigger, and my setup is a bit heavier. To be perfectly honest, I am not yet fully on board with this whole minimalistic travel but I have got to say, my shoulders are thankful.</p>

<h2>Making Yourself at Home</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve learned from <a href="http://thebucketlistfamily.com">the bucket list family</a> that it&rsquo;s really important to unpack as soon as we get to a hotel. Especially since it&rsquo;s easy to do when there&rsquo;s little clothing in the bags. This way we feel at home whenever we go, even if we&rsquo;re just staying at a hotel for a single night. Every item is in it&rsquo;s place, and there&rsquo;s no digging through the bags for clothes or gadgets.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/our-hotel-in-nassau-bahamas.jpg" title="Our hotel in Nassau, Bahamas." ></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve also found that we really value downtime, every day we travel. Taking time to unwind (however long it needs to be) in the hotel room, a coffee shop, or anywhere else helps take the edge off flying and booking accommodations and the subconscious pressure to have fun as a pair.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve learned this the hard way on our first trip together. Our days were packed with activities and sightseeing stops, and we were at each other&rsquo;s throats by the end of the trip. Lesson learned.</p>

    <updated>2017-08-04T17:33:16+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/desktop-notifications-from-chrome-secure-shell</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past year or two I&rsquo;ve been working in the cloud. I use Chrome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en">Secure Shell</a> to connect to my machines, and it works rather well. In fact, I moved away from my work Linux/Mac laptops towards an <a href="http://amzn.to/2hv68Ck">HP Chromebook</a>, which fullfilled both requirements I had: a browser and a terminal. One thing I missed about a Linux machine though is lack of <code>notify-send</code>-like functionality, especially when working with long-running builds.</p>

<p>Yesterday I pinged hterm team for assistance with this matter, and turns out recent release of Secure Shell supports Chrome desktop notifications! Furthermore, two amazing engineers (thanks Andrew and Mike!) crafted an <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/601549/3/hterm/etc/hterm-notify.sh">hterm-notify</a> script, which propagates notifications to Chrome, and by extent to desktop!</p>

<p>I made a few tiny changes, mainly since I don&rsquo;t use <code>screen</code>, and tmux sets my <code>$TERM</code> to <code>screen-256color</code> for some reason:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
# Copyright 2017 The Chromium OS Authors. All rights reserved.
# Use of this source code is governed by a BSD-style license that can be
# found in the LICENSE file.

# Write an error message and exit.
# Usage: &lt;message&gt;
die() {
  echo "ERROR: $*"
  exit 1
}

# Send a notification.
# Usage: [title] [body]
notify() {
  local title="${1-}" body="${2-}"

  case ${TERM-} in
  screen*)  # This one's really tmux
    printf '\ePtmux;\e\e]777;notify;%s;%s\a\e\\' "${title}" "${body}"
    ;;
  *)        # This one's plain hterm
    printf '\e]777;notify;%s;%s\a' "${title}" "${body}"
    ;;
  esac
}

# Write tool usage and exit.
# Usage: [error message]
usage() {
  if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then
    exec 1&gt;&amp;2
  fi
  cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Usage: hterm-notify [options] &lt;title&gt; [body]

Send a notification to hterm.

Notes:
- The title should not have a semi-colon in it.
- Neither field should have escape sequences in them.
  Best to stick to plain text.
EOF

  if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then
    echo
    die "$@"
  else
    exit 0
  fi
}

main() {
  set -e

  while [ $# -gt 0 ]; do
    case $1 in
    -h|--help)
      usage
      ;;
    -*)
      usage "Unknown option: $1"
      ;;
    *)
      break
      ;;
    esac
  done

  if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    die "Missing message to send"
  fi
  if [ $# -gt 2 ]; then
    usage "Too many arguments"
  fi

  notify "$@"
}
main "$@"
</code></pre>

<p>Throwing this in as <code>~/bin/notify</code> (not forgetting to <code>chmod +x</code> and having <code>~/bin</code> in the <code>$PATH</code>) I can get a notification when a particular long running command is complete:</p>

<pre><code>sleep 30 &amp;&amp; notify Hooray "The sleep's done!"
</code></pre>

    <id>http://www.rosipov.com/blog/journey-of-a-friend</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>A close friend of mine has a story similar to mine. She wanted to share it for a while now, and I&rsquo;m humbled she chose my blog as a medium for telling her inspiring story to the strangers on the Internet:</em></p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/friends-trip-plane.jpg" title="At Narita Airport, Japan." ></p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t count the number of times I have attempted to tell this story on paper. It all started 8 months ago when my then-husband, let&rsquo;s call him Carl, told me that he no longer loved me and was in love with someone else. There are a few moments in life that seem to happen in slow motion and this was one of them. Until then, my life had been being Carl&rsquo;s wife and in the blink of an eye, I had to figure out who I was in a world without Carl. I forced myself to write every thoughts I had, dark, depressed, once a day but it didn&rsquo;t stick. I bought various domain names hoping that it would give me the final push to start writing all this down but all the sites remained &ldquo;under construction&rdquo;. So here is my final attempt to write this up, organize my thoughts and hopefully let someone going through this know that they are not alone. How did I get here? Well funny you should ask, pull up a chair and listen to my tale.</p>

<p>Carl and I met when we were 22 and 18 respectively. It was far from love at first sight but he intrigued me. I had just got out of an unhealthy relationship and wanted something different and Carl was that, unapologetically himself. Up until then, I had always felt pressure to conform to the idea of who others wanted me to be and meeting Carl, who let&rsquo;s be honest was a straight nerd, was surprisingly refreshing and attractive. We dated for 5 years before getting married. We struggled with money throughout the first years of our relationship so when the opportunity to make more at a job I was unqualified for presented itself, we jumped at the chance. We packed our bags and moved for my job. Thus started the beginning of the end. I was so focused on keeping said job that I overworked, became a ball of nerves and lost all desires to do anything outside of work. While I struggled with the demand of the job, Carl found refuge with his younger, funner coworkers. We started living separate lives, which eventually led up to the fateful day when my husband told me that he loved someone else.</p>

<p>I will not bore you with the details of my attempts to become a stable, contributing member of society. It included a lot of sleepless night, Nutella for dinner, and lies. I would smile everyday as I got to work, joked with co-workers and call family members and friends to discuss everything and anything when deep down all I wanted to do was to crawl in a dark place and wallow in my sadness. This period led to a lot of physical and mental changes. I lost 20 pounds in 2 months due to stress but the vain person in me was happy to see myself get skinny. Mentally, I had to come clean to my family and explain to them how I became the first divorced person in a deeply catholic family. I created a smaller, more dependable community of friends, most of them divorced or separated who could provide me with a different perspective. I had to admit to my manager that I could not continue work as is. Maintaining the lies became exhausting and emotionally draining. One had to give and after a heart to heart with my manager, I decided to cash out all my vacation hours and head out to Southeast Asia for a month.</p>

<p>Prior to Southeast Asia, I had never vacationed alone. For the first time in my life, I was in charge of my itinerary and my own entertainment. It was overwhelming. After discussing the trip with veteran solo travelers, I only purchased one ticket. All I knew was my departing and arrival date from and to the US. I arrived at my first stop, Ho Chi Minh City, at midnight on a blazing hot night. The bustle of the city took me aback and made me question the trip in its entirety. I was running away and I knew it. I have always thought of myself as a strong person but dealing with this separation made me feel like a scared kid. Just as I was going through this mental exercise, my cab driver hit a motorcyclist and the impact broke one of his side view mirrors. The driver angrily got out of the car and argued with the individual he had just hit. They spoke in Vietnamese for what felt like hours and came back without explanations. At that point, I was sure that this entire trip was a mistake and if I had spoken the language, I would have asked the driver to turn and drop me back at the airport.</p>

<p>The rest of the drive to the hotel was much calmer with the occasional surprise looks from locals seeing a black tourist through a taxi window at midnight. Blame it on stress, jet lag or even regret but for the first time in months I slept for more than 4 hours. Somewhat invigorated by the night of sleep, I decided to venture into the city to find food. After multiple failed attempts to cross one of the main traffic arteries, I gave up and sat down miserably looking at a bowl of pho from a restaurant located in the same block as my hotel. The Ho Chi Minh City traffic had won once again. I sat by a window seat, staring into the street, dreading the rest of this Southeast Asia trip. To travel Asia required an adventure spirit and it only took me 2 days to recognize that this was not one of my hidden talents. I told myself, only half believing it, that my second stop might be different but deep down, I knew I was on my way to yet another disappointing time.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/friends-trip-sleep.png" title="Screenshot of sleep activity during the trip." ></p>

<p>Bangkok was a life changing stop for my trip and myself as a person. I had contacted a Turkish-based traveler on CouchSurfing visiting Bangkok during the same time. I was excited to meet up with someone that could understand the struggles of being in an unfamiliar country. This guy learned English by watching American sitcoms but did not let his basic knowledge of English or his lack of Thai stop him. It led to some interesting conversations about the meaning of &ldquo;Netflix and Chill&rdquo; and other American colloquialisms. Seeing him tackle the challenges of navigating a foreign city showed me what my journey could look like. Not only did he help me see the wonders of being open to the world, but he also inadvertently started my process of self love. Let me explain. To avoid having to carry a heavy suitcase and pay airline fees, I limited my wardrobe to whatever could fit in a carry-on backpack. As a relatively fashion-focused person, this decision was uncomfortable. With that in mind and the unforgiving sun, I was either dripped in sweat or looking like a lost 1920s explorer. Having someone still think that I looked good in those conditions did wonders for my broken self esteem. We spend 4 adventures filled days and parted ways. We still talk to each other and I am grateful to have encountered him so early on during my trip. I finally embraced the lack of structure and decided to thrive through it. Remember this word &ldquo;Thrive&rdquo;, it will come back later on in this story.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/friends-trip-construction.jpg" title="Temple in Bangkok." ></p>

<p>After Bangkok, I headed to Chiang Mai for the Lantern Festival. Given my positive experience with CouchSurfing, I decided to continue using it  to meet locals and travelers throughout my stops. I used all the lessons learned in Bangkok and forced myself to open up to people. I had a heart wrenching conversation with an American girl trying to find herself in the world despite familial and societal pressures. We quickly bonded and within minutes were sharing our deepest darkest fears. In addition to looking differently at people, I started focusing on things that made me happy. I took a Thai cooking class, a skill I desperately lacked in, and learned Muay Thai. With each new activity I undertook, I felt a change inside of me. I was slowly starting to fall in love with myself.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/friends-trip-market.jpg" title="Cooking class in Chiang Mai." ></p>

<p>Next stop: Singapore. A few coworkers happened to be there around the same time and I had always been intrigued by the country. I experienced the country&rsquo;s renowned cleanliness, mix of cultures and wide array of food options. It was in Singapore that I learned another fact about myself: I loved meeting new people. I struck conversations with random people in elevators, buses or hotels. Not having an itinerary turned out to be a blessing. I ended up extending my time in Singapore and enjoyed some retail therapy from one of the cities&#8217; amazing malls.</p>

<p>My goal for this trip was not only self discovery but also to be fully emerged in each country’s history and culture. So that meant that I purposely landed in each new locations not knowing anything about religious beliefs, language and social norms. It worked in my favor up until I arrived in Kuala Lumpur. On my first day in the country, I had planned to follow my typical plan and visit the national and art museums to learn about Malaysian culture. Unfortunately, I arrived during yellow and red shirt protests. All local attractions were closed and I ended up smack in  a protest. While I am sure I was never in any real danger, being stuck in the middle of a screaming and upset group of people was scary. I took refuge in a nearby mall and ended up being stranded there for 4 hours. No taxis or Ubers wanted to come to my location due to road closures and fears of property damages. With each hour, I got more and more scared and worried. When I was finally able to get to my hotel, I made arrangements to leave the day after to go to Cambodia. I am hoping to go back to KL and get a chance to see all the city has to offer.</p>

<p>After my failure in Malaysia, I landed in Siem Reap defeated. Cambodia was breathtaking. It was the first time that I saw real poverty and luxury in the same location. It was in Siem Reap that I realized how small my problems really were. I saw and talked to people struggling to afford day to day life and here I was suffering from a broken heart. Siem Reap helped me refocus and gave me a different perspective. It wasn&rsquo;t about what my problems were but how I approached them. I was not as powerless as I thought I was. I could make the choice to not let my situations impact me and move forward. There, I met some of the most life-loving individuals. As we were exchanging travel stories and tips, we all realized that we were into the same type of music. One of the members of the group ran to his hotel room and brought back his turntables. We had an impromptu dance party in the middle of Siem Reap. I sang and danced my heart away to familiar songs in a an unfamiliar land with unfamiliar people. At that time, I realized that I was happy. For the first time in months, there were no hidden emotions behind my smile, it was pure happiness and I never wanted it to end.</p>

<p>I went to Angkor Wat at sunrise and felt lost and transported to a different world visiting all the cultural sites of the country. The Tuol Seng prison and the lives lost there forced me to put my life into perspective. I realized the following facts that I knew deep down but up until then was unwilling to accept: 1) I was getting divorced, 2) I was deeply hurt that I wasn&rsquo;t enough for my husband , 3) I still loved Carl and needed to respect his choice, 4) This was not the end for me. Weirdly, coming to these realizations made me calmer. I knew what I had to do. I had to use the remaining days of this trip to try to discover as much as I could about myself.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/friends-trip-skyline.jpg" title="Sunrise at Angkor Wat, Siem Reap." ></p>

<p>Along with self discovery and adventure-filled days came the not-so fun ones. Thanksgiving day landed while I was in Phnom Penh. As an immigrant, Thanksgiving meant spending time with Carl&rsquo;s family. Up until Thanksgiving day, I thought about Carl during my trip but never more than &ldquo;Carl would have loved eating this, or visiting this area or enjoyed talking with this individual&rdquo;. But as I was staring at my plate of mashed potatoes and turkey, I not only felt a overwhelming sense of loss but also felt shame. Only a few hours prior, I was reveling in the country&rsquo;s history and congratulating myself in having a fresh new perspective on life. I could not finish my plate and walked back to my hotel room beaten. For the first time since I started on this adventure, I was happy that I was traveling alone. I spent the rest of my day watching TV locked in my hotel room.</p>

<p>After 3 weeks on the road, I headed back to Vietnam for my last week abroad. For convenience, I reserved a room in the same hotel I had checked at the beginning of this trip. I suddenly realized that the person who checked in 3 weeks ago was not the person who was walking in. I couldn&rsquo;t put my finger on what it was specifically but I felt more confident and more at peace with myself. A former coworker traveling in Ho Chi Minh City at the same time reached out and we connected for dinner. His first words to me were &ldquo;&hellip; so, what is going on, where is your husband?&rdquo; We hadn&rsquo;t seen each other for 4 years and apparently, my social media accounts had become a &ldquo;Eat, Pray, Love&rdquo; tribute. I explained my current situation, no longer ashamed of the fact that I had a failed marriage, and we traded travel stories. He had not left his hotel room until our meeting because he was overwhelmed by the city, especially the traffic. I can&rsquo;t put into words how satisfying it was for me to be able to teach him how to cross the road. I fondly remembered my old self, seating defeated in front of a bowl of pho. I couldn&rsquo;t have engineered a better end to 4 wonderful weeks in paradise.</p>

<p>Of course I glanced over many more experiences, people and locations visited. It would take days to write it all. I came back to the US on a high that I knew would not last but I was determined to keep it as long as possible. I had felt true happiness and connected with new people for the first time in 7 months. I was accepted even after I showed my true, deeply flawed self, but most importantly, I met myself. I discovered the foundations of who I was, what made me smile, happy and tick. I realized that I could survive, not just survive, I could thrive in a foreign environment and to commemorate it, I tattooed “Thrive” on my shoulder to always remind myself of that feeling. Told you that word was going to come back.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s time to write more about my adventures. I&rsquo;ve been traveling and living in my car for nearly a year now, mostly full-time (excluding hotels on infrequent business trips, occasional friends&#8217; couches, or AirBnB a few times I was sick or wanted a home). I&rsquo;d love to share what I&rsquo;ve learned over the past year.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/camping-in-california.jpg" title="Camping in California." ></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how a typical conversation with someone who just learned I&rsquo;m living in my car goes:</p>

<h2>You live in <em>that?</em></h2>

<p>Yes I do. I think I need to start from the beginning.</p>

<p>About a year ago I wasn&rsquo;t in a very good place emotionally. I&rsquo;ve been going through a divorce, my dream company declined my job application (spoiler: I got the job this year, yay), and my landlord decided that 12 tiny houses on a property isn&rsquo;t enough and it&rsquo;s time to kick everyone out to build a more dense apartment complex. I didn&rsquo;t do much outside of going to work and sleeping.</p>

<p>I think I saw an opportunity to do something drastic with my life, and I decided to take a leap of faith. I gave away everything I couldn&rsquo;t fit in the back of the car, and set on a road trip across continental United States (after spending a month doing test drives and adjusting my setup dozens of times).</p>

<p>The experience turned out to be more enjoyable than having a house.</p>

<h2>How do you even fit in there?!</h2>

<p>Everyone I talk to thinks the space is really cramped up, and I have to sleep curled into a ball in the trunk (or something along those lines).</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/feet-under-blanket.jpg" title="Pictures make it look really cramped up, but it's rather spacious inside." ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m 5&#8217;11&#8221;, and I have a flat twin-width bed in that&rsquo;s around 7 feet long (it&rsquo;s been awhile since I measured). I sleep on an inflatable pad wrapped in a sleeping bag, on top of another sleeping bag all wrapped in a silk sleeping bag cover - my composite mattress is about 3 inches thick. I use regular blankets and pillows, adding or removing a few depending on the temperature outside.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s one of the most comfortable beds I&rsquo;ve ever slept on.</p>

<h2>Poor soul, want to crash on my couch?</h2>

<p>This is an offer I get as soon as somebody learns I&rsquo;m living in a car (it&rsquo;s right up there with &ldquo;You must be saving so much money not paying rent!&rdquo;). Most people are really nice, and offer a place to stay. I think it stems from an understandable notion that one probably would only live in a car because of being in a bad situation.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/inside-of-the-car-view-from-the-back.jpg" title="View of the bed from the back of the car." ></p>

<p>Oddly enough I really enjoy the lifestyle, and I always reject the offers (always appreciate them though). Sometimes I contemplate getting a small RV or a van, but I&rsquo;m way to attached to air conditioning on demand and 50 mpg on the highway. But I probably won&rsquo;t need to crash on your couch.</p>

<p>I think the TL;DR here is that majority of people are really nice, once you get out and get to interact with them enough.</p>

<h2>Why on Earth are you still living in a car?</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s more than one reason at this point. Part of it is that it has become a habit now. The biggest reason is probably all the fun things it has forced me to do.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve met a lot of cool people, tried out so many things I would&rsquo;ve never considered trying, and found exciting hobbies I would&rsquo;ve never had otherwise. I&rsquo;m also now in a great shape physically since I usually have to hit up the gym to shower.</p>

<p>It also made me confront my inner demons, since car living tends to consistently provide me with time to be alone with my thoughts - be it driving somewhere, or falling asleep in an area where I wouldn&rsquo;t want to use electronics. I feel more in tune with myself, and I can close my eyes without being afraid of stream of thoughts keeping me awake at night.</p>

<h2>That&rsquo;s cool! What else is inside?</h2>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/before-and-after-bike-rack.jpg" title="Bike rack: before and after." ></p>

<h3>The front</h3>

<p>I try to keep driver&rsquo;s seat and front passenger seat area clean and empty, with storing some low key items in passenger seat leg space &ndash; portable 12V vacuum, water jug, water boiler/thermos.</p>

<p>The front seats are separated from the back by a dark curtain. Unless you shine a (powerful) flashlight inside a car it&rsquo;s almost impossible to tell the curtain is there.</p>

<h3>The back</h3>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/window-cutout-from-the-inside.jpg" title="In addition to curtains I also have custom-made window cutouts." ></p>

<p>One of the passenger seats is lowered to make a bed. The bed is extended with a wooden panel specifically made for this purpose which creates a flat surface about 7 foot long. A mattress with a blanket and some throws creates /a nice homey look.</p>

<p>Under the bed is &ldquo;the basement&rdquo; &ndash; large clear container where I store winter clothes and things I rarely use. If I&rsquo;m camping extra water jugs go here as well. And some bicycle maintenance stuff, and extra pairs of shoes.</p>

<p>I use the other rear passenger seat as my primary relaxing area when I&rsquo;m inside the car. There&rsquo;s a little trashcan stuck to the floor in between the seats.</p>

<h3>Cargo and the bike</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s an old suitcase I use for organizing various cooking and camping supplies. It&rsquo;s split into nine compartments by some separators I&rsquo;ve put together. This is where I have some freeze dried veggies, spices, grains and pasta, cooking oils, camping pots and pans, equipment for cleaning the dishes, etc. On top of the suitcase is a backpack where I keep clothes. There&rsquo;s also a propane burner, camping table and a chair, as well as a toiletry kit. Dirty laundry goes in a dry bag.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/cooking-supplies-in-the-suitcase.jpg" title="Cooking supplies in a suitcase." ></p>

<p>I also have a bike strapped to the outside of the car, exploring places by bike after arriving to a new city is very rewarding!</p>

<h2>Isn&rsquo;t it dangerous?</h2>

<p>You often read stories of people suffocating in their own cars, and it&rsquo;s something to be aware of. There are a few rules I follow to be safe, and there are three main dangers here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Carbon monoxide poisoning.</li>
<li>Carbon dioxide poisoning.</li>
<li>Extreme temperatures.</li>
</ol>


<p>I sleep with carbon monoxide alarm not far from my head, and my car is a hybrid &ndash; meaning it only turns itself on once in a while when batteries need to be recharged. Sometimes I sleep with my car on, and sometimes not. The alarm never went off so far (it works, I check regularly).</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (stuff you exhale) poisoning is not a silent killer (unlike carbon monoxide), humans are pretty good at detecting high concentration of CO2 &ndash; panic attack on par with a headache are a rather clear sign of this happening. I keep windows cracked open most of the time, plus my AC is often on.</p>

<p>I love sleeping at low temperatures (50-60F is my comfort zone for snuggling up under a blanket), but if local forecast suggests the temperature will drop below 50F at night - I make sure to sleep with AC on. If it&rsquo;s below freezing - I roll up the windows, otherwise I still keep them cracked open a little.</p>

<p>And if it&rsquo;s really cold and I don&rsquo;t want to run AC all night, or I just feel like I want to stay inside for a bit - I can just get AirBnB for a couple of nights. Speaking of, by pure chance I stayed at Gayle Laakmann McDowell&rsquo;s guest house few weeks ago, and I left with great memories and a signed copy of Cracking the Code Interview. Bonus point for meeting cool people.</p>

<h2>How does Prius AC work anyway?</h2>

<p>This question pops up often enough to address here (along with condensation concerns from seasoned vandwellers).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a hybrid with two electric motors assisting the internal combustion engine. The electric motors power up from a ~1.3 kWh battery, which is recharged using the engine and regenerative brakes. That battery is connected to the 12V battery, and as long as there&rsquo;s gas in the car &ndash; both batteries will be charged. In practice, if the car isn&rsquo;t moving, engine turns on every half an hour or so for a little under a minute to recharge the batteries.</p>

<p>This allows one to keep the car on and use the AC throughout the night. AC also keeps the moisture level at bay, preventing condensation. I also noticed that when I don&rsquo;t use the AC cracked windows help with condensation (I have rain guards for stealth and keeping the rain out).</p>

<h2>Um, how do you do bathroom stuff?</h2>

<p>If we&rsquo;re talking about changing - there&rsquo;s plenty of space in the back of the car to change.</p>

<p>For hygiene - I use gym showers (I take quite a lot of classes), or wet wipes if I&rsquo;m out camping or shower is otherwise unavailable. I&rsquo;m now kind of an expert on all sorts of wipes. Any restroom works for brushing my teeth at night, and in US it&rsquo;s very difficult not to be within the vicinity of a public bathroom.</p>

<h2>Where do you park at night?</h2>

<p>Rest stops are the best when I travel, since everyone on a rest stop is just resting/sleeping in their car.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/prius-lit-up-at-night.jpg" title="Christmas lights make inside more homey." ></p>

<p>There are so many places to park: since this is just a passenger car, anywhere where cars can park is good. Usually somewhere with either a lot of foot traffic (or the exact opposite). Parking lots of 24/7 business, residential areas, anywhere and anytime.</p>

<h2>What do your friends and coworkers say?</h2>

<p>Most colleagues and acquaintances don&rsquo;t know, since it&rsquo;s not really a topic that pops up during a normal conversation. I go to work and social events well groomed, with clean clothes, and (I&rsquo;d like to think) demonstrating a sense of style.</p>

<p>Few friends and colleagues that do know that I live in the car don&rsquo;t see it as anything out of the ordinary (past the initial shock of course). I can&rsquo;t remember the last time conversation got stirred towards car living with any of my close friends. A few are rather jealous but reluctant to make the move. I try not to preach.</p>

<p>My love life surprisingly didn&rsquo;t suffer. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I tend to pursue women just as odd as me, but me living in a car didn&rsquo;t have any negative effects, and even got me a date or two. If someone doesn&rsquo;t want to go out with you because of living arrangements - they would probably not make a good partner in a long run.</p>

<h2>Do strangers bother you?</h2>

<p>When you observe people you start noticing how much everyone&rsquo;s concerned with what people think of them. In fact, most people so concerned with themselves - that they don&rsquo;t look around. Encounters with people who notice I live in a car are nearly non-existent. Nobody cares to look inside one of the hundred cars in a parking lot or parked on the side of the street.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a few rather friendly encounters with parking lot security, with people usually just demonstrating concern. Until I share my setup that is, then concern is often replacement with mild jealousy.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/making-a-meal-at-a-rest-stop.jpg" title="I sometimes make meals at rest stops." ></p>

<p>Most encounters with strangers approaching me happen at rest stops, since I usually don&rsquo;t hide much &ndash; there are enough misfits and travelers. Every encounter like that I&rsquo;ve had was positive, with people commenting on how amazing my setup is, how they wished they could do a similar thing, or sharing a story about their own travels.</p>

<h2>How do you not go crazy?</h2>

<p>This is where the fun part starts. You see, the thing about living in the car is how boring it is. There&rsquo;s really not much you can do in a confined space. So I have to get out of my way to entertain myself.</p>

<p>I take a lot of classes like various martial arts or archery. I tried miniature painting, rock climbing, long distance cycling. There are numerous things I&rsquo;m &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to do in order to keep myself entertained.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things I do inside the car too. Writing or coding (even though I prefer coffee shops), rare indulgence in video games (I recently picked up a gaming laptop for this), guitalele (it&rsquo;s a ukulele-sized guitar), reading. Drawing, keeping a journal, or just relaxing.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/laptop-hooked-up-to-the-headrest.jpg" title="I setup laptop at an eye level and use external keyboard." ></p>

<p>And of course there are people. When I travel I end up meeting a lot of different people. I often get invited to join somebody at a campsite, and we&rsquo;d cook a meal together or share some stories. Or somebody sitting next to me in a coffee shop works in the same industry and we grab lunch to mingle and share interesting ideas. Wherever I go I get lucky enough to make friends for a couple of minutes, hours, days, and sometimes months.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s next for you?</h2>

<p>For now, I&rsquo;m used to living in a car. I sometimes pop by AirBnBs or friends&#8217; places for a couple of days, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say I enjoy being tied down to a single location for a long period of time.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rosipov.com/images/posts/cycling-by-the-ocean.jpg" title="Cycling on the West Coast is the best." ></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m contemplating getting an RV to be able to stand up inside and have more room and privacy, but potential difficulties with air conditioning at night, atrocious gas mileage, and inefficient and noisy generators for my power usage are a concern of mine.</p>

<p>Once in a while I contemplate getting myself an apartment. Since it&rsquo;s now winter I end up staying in AirBnBs more often, but I feel like having a place to call home makes it harder for me to a fight a lazy person inside me. I like when that person is forced to learn, explore, and create.</p>
