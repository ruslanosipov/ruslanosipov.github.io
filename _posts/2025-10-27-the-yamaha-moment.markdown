There’s this old joke:

> * Me: I’d like to buy a piano.
> * Yamaha: We got you!
> * Me: I’m also looking for a motorcycle, where could I get one?
> * Yamaha: You’re not gonna believe this...

I just had my own Yamaha moment. I was looking for a good pepper grinder, and I just found that one of the best pepper grinders on the market is made by… Peugeot. Yup, apparently the car company produced great pepper grinders, bicycles, and cars, in that order.

Live and learn.

And yeah, the [pepper mill](https://amzn.to/4hbyagw) is sturdy, feels and looks great, and the grinding mechanism comes with a lifetime warranty.
