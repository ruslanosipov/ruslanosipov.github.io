I've had this blog for 13 years now. I started it as a way to publish my programming journey, as I was learning C, Python, and tools like the command line or Vim. Since then, I've matured, both as a software engineer and as a person. Different things interest me these days. I've been managing engineers for some time and have things to say that I haven't yet shared. I've also gotten into personal finance, traveled and lived out of my car for a year, and I'm even starting to enjoy engaging in the AI discourse. In the past couple of months, I've moved further towards subjective opinion pieces, which I enjoy greatly.

While my blog was never huge, I enjoyed my few thousand monthly users, most through organic search. This was primarily driven by the tutorial-like nature of my writing. Even when I would talk about my experience [traveling the US in a Prius](https://rosipov.internal/blog/prius-adventures-a-year-later/), I'd turn the article into a tutorial with step-by-step guides and tips.

After taking a little over a year of a break from writing, I'm back at it again. It was really the time afforded to me by my paternity leave that reminded me how much I like writing, and how much I enjoy others connecting with my writing. And now I don't particularly care about wide viewership; I am more interested in the discourse, in the community.

A friend of mine, Patrick, started a newsletter after retiring. He sent a thought piece on AI to a humble private mailing list of 20 people. I think I was the only person who responded, but we've had some fantastic conversations. In fact, Patrick inspired me to [write about AI](https://rosipov.com/blog/ai-and-the-new-junior-engineer/), and even to pivot a small part of my role at Google to be defined by driving responsible AI adoption.

Since then, I've learned of new blog discovery mechanisms through communities like [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org). I discovered my personal favorites like the [winther blog](https://winther.sysctl.dk/) or the [uncountable thoughts](https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/). I even found some local San Diego bloggers on the chain, like [Anthony Ciccarello](https://www.ciccarello.me/), [gRegor Morrill](https://gregorlove.com/), or [Joe Crawford](https://artlung.com/). It's been exciting to explore this new world of interconnected blogs.

It's super engaging being able to connect with fellow bloggers. I can respond to their writing over email, get a thoughtful message, or even see a response to something I wrote on their own blog. I'm enjoying the quality local discourse and happy to be following local organic free-range fair trade blogs.
