Oh, how the time flies. I published the first edition of Mastering Vim in 2018. Since then, it has been translated to Japanese and received its second edition.

In 2021, I wrote about [how much money publishing Mastering Vim has earned][1], and I think now's the perfect time to get an update.

Mastering Vim was never meant to become a bestseller, but it did fairly well given the fact that I haven't done much promotional work and haven't been particularly active in Vim space since then.

For the first edition of the book, I receive 16% royalties. For the second edition, I negotiated a step-up based on publisher's net receipts (over the lifetime of the book): it starts as low as 16% and climbs as high as 25% once the publisher nets £40,000 from my book.

Here's year over year sales and revenue data, you can see it to be predictable and steady:

| Year | Copies | Revenue |
|------|--------|---------|
| 2018 | 284*   | $363*   | 
| 2019 | 533    | $1,433  |
| 2020 | 548    | $1,533  |
| 2021 | 458    | $1,752  | 
| 2022 | 386    | $1,403  | 
| 2023 | 279    | $1,112  | 
| 2024 | 381    | $1,206  | 

\* Mastering Vim was published in Q4 2018.

On average, I earn about $5 for every print book sold, and a bit over $2 for every ebook sold.

In addition to book sales, I also receive a portion of translation fees (for the Japanese translation), as well as subscriptions to the publisher's service (something I do not promote nor care about).

| Book sales | Translation fees | Subscriptions |
|------------|------------------|---------------|
| $8,803     | $1,669           | $572          | 

In the past seven years, Mastering Vim has sold close to 3,000 copies (not including the Japanese edition, which I have no visibility into). This has grossed slightly over $11,000 in total revenue. While this amount is definitely not enough to live off the royalty income, I have truly enjoyed learning more about the domain and becoming a subject matter expert throughout the writing process. Having a published book feels like a legacy artifact that I can be proud of. Of course, the quarterly royalty statements are a nice bonus as well.

If you'd like to see the book for yourself, [Mastering Vim can be picked up on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2EfGaN5).
