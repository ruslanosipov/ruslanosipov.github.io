I didn't finish college. I studied airspace engineering for two years in Russia, where the state paid me a small stipend to learn. But the structured curriculum felt mind-numbingly monolithic, and for the first time in my life, I faced intellectual adversity I couldn't or didn't want to overcome. My failure to thrive in the rigid academic world didn't lead to a rejection of academic ideas, instead, I think I subconsciously doubled down. I abandoned academia's messy traditions and sought refuge in a different temple: the worship of verifiable data and optimal solutions. I don't fetishize formal education, yet I somehow adopted its most extreme ideology. So it hit me when I found myself nodding along to Cal Newport's latest blog post:

> "We hesitate to take a strong stance because we fear the data might reveal we were wrong, rendering us guilty of a humiliating sin in technocratic totalitarianism, letting the messiness of individual human emotion derail us from the optimal operating procedure." - Cal Newport, [Don't ignore your moral intuition about phones](https://calnewport.com/dont-ignore-your-moral-intuition-about-phones/)

The quiet, persistent anxiety that hums beneath every opinion I hold wasn't just a feeling; it was a doctrine. I am a technocratic totalitarian on the inside, a [tech-priest](/blog/lessons-in-tech-heresy-in-the-ai-age/), worshipping science. A blind faith that the world is a complex machine, every aspect of which could be optimized. Every aspect, figured out. Every aspect, rationalized. In that temple, being wrong isn't just a mistake; it's a humiliating sin. An ultimate act of heresy. And as a devout follower, a zealot, I fell into shying away from holding strong opinions.

Part of this came from my childhood - I could be described as a gifted child, and things came easy to me. School was trivial, new languages weren't hard to learn, and the only time I've faced intellectual adversity was in a university - and my fierce disdain for authority played a huge part in that too (but that's a story for another day). I grew up with a belief that I'm smart, capable, and nothing is beyond my grasp if I put my mind to it (thanks, mom).

A decade and a half of working in tech solidified it. Surrounded by deeply technical peers and academics, the beliefs rubbed off on me. Software engineering is perceived as a precise and purely mathematical craft. Corporate culture, with its religious focus on quantifiable metrics, only entrenched this belief. It's a modern version of the [McNamara fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNamara_fallacy): the idea that if you can't measure it, it simply doesn't exist. That call for every decision to be backed by data became my gospel.

And it's really, really hard to hold opinions outside of a narrow field I'm able to build deep expertise in. So here I am, going through life, scared to have opinions about things because deep down I'm afraid to be proven wrong, which isn't just a social failure - but a violation of my deeply held core beliefs.

Which brings me to parenthood. Watching my daughter grow has made me think about what it means to be a human. About deeply seeded biological instinct, fundamentally irrational behaviors, intuition, intangible human connection, love, and the joys of existing in this world.

For me, parenting is a deeply instinctual activity. While I tried to approach child rearing from a perspective rooted in research, turned out 1) there's really not that much science about children out there, and 2) babies aren't inherently rational and logical human beings.

When I started researching baby slings to wear my little one, I've read a lot about hip dysplasia - it's a condition in newborns, where the hip bones don't fit in the joint sockets right. And there's lots of "maybes" on the subject, and one point stuck in my mind: "we are very likely to never know if baby wearing impacts hip dysplasia as studying this on infants would be deeply unethical". And yeah, science shouldn't really toy with children's futures, and it largely doesn't, and because of it raising children isn't as well understood despite it being an activity humanity has lots of practice with.

And with many decisions, we just had to go with our gut, advise from parents, friends, and doctors - most of which was hearsay. The technocrats could burn me at the stake for this!

And then we met Leila (name changed for privacy). Leila is a lactation consultant - turns out breastfeeding is hard, since both the baby and the mom are figuring out how to do this together for the first time. Leila is also a postpartum doula, a certified marriage councilor, a church pastor, essential oil distributor, and she even has a YouTube plaque sitting in her office, sitting on a shelf among the all the crystals.

Here's the thing, Leila was instrumental to getting our daughter to take on a breast. And it didn't stop there. She'd make many recommendations - from holistic medicine to bizarre techniques that I'm pretty sure summon some kind of spirits. And guess what, when it's 3 am and my baby's hasn't stopped crying for six hours - you're damn right I'll follow the instructions to the letter. Because those things worked.

Why did the techniques work? I'm too sleep deprived to analyze or care. They just worked.

In certain social circles - the ones I tend to find myself in often - intuition is devalued. It's treated as a crutch, something deeply stepped in biases and human emotion, something to be avoided if possible. It's the enemy of the optimal, and Leila should've been the final boss in my crusade against irrationality.

At 3 am, holding a finally quiet baby, the technocrat in me had a full-blown meltdown. I couldn't file Leila under "science", but I couldn't label her a "fraud" either. She simply existed in a category my framework had no room for: effective, but unprovable. Her success wasn't based on a methodology I could verify, but on something I had taught myself to dismiss as a flaw: embodied wisdom. And in that moment, the sterile temple I had built in my mind began to crumble. The fear of being wrong - the humiliating sin - suddenly seemed absurd. If Leila's messy, intuitive, spiritual-adjacent techniques could be right, then what did "wrong" even mean anymore? This was the crack in the foundation that forced me to revisit the very lens through which I saw the world, and with it, the simple act of holding an opinion.

What is an opinion, really? It isn't just a flawed hypothesis waiting to be disproven. It's a messy collection of experience, tradition, and gut feelings. It's the scraps of knowledge, thoughts, and love, all glued together by the essence of our humanity. Opinions are a form of embodied wisdom. They are unique, colorful, and deeply human. Opinions are personal. I'm excited to share more of mine, and I'm looking forward to hearing yours.
