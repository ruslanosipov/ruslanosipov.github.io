Financial independence is one of the core values in the Osipov household. We invest for the long term and maintain a stock-to-bond ratio that reflects our goals and risk tolerance. However, over time, the ratio gets out of date, and we use a handy spreadsheet to catch the imbalance and inform our adjustments.

It's no secret that I love tinkering with spreadsheets: we keep a master spreadsheet which tracks our networth, income, expenses, mortgage, allocation, and any other little thing our heart desires. We perform a major annual financial review around New Year's Eve, complete with presentations and champagne -  it's quite an event, and yes, we're dorks. It'd be much harder to extract insights without diligent record-keeping throughout the year.

Each year we make a new copy of the spreadsheet, and we're on 9th iteration at this point. Initially our spreadsheet was based on [IndyPendent's One Sheet to Rule Them All](https://forum.mrmoneymustache.com/share-your-badassity/one-sheet-to-rule-them-all/), but we've diverged quite a long time ago.

Here's a screenshot of the sheet we use for tracking allocation within our portfolio and as a guide for occasional rebalancing (with some sample data filled in):

It allows me to set targets and see our current distributions: we care about stocks vs bonds split as well as US vs international market. It's simple, manual, but has been working well for us. Just like with our investment philosophy, simple truly is better than complex (thanks, [PEP 20](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/)).

Over the years I tried more complex and "smart" solutions, but nothing beats a simple spreadsheet like this one.

I extracted the allocation sheet from our mega-spreadsheet: feel free to [copy Ruslan's Allocation Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZikRE07AZP6oWrPP1RAIdQI2zKcEqsBqOVJX_1pO-I/copy){:target="_blank"} and tinker with it to your liking.
