I haven't posted on my blog in a while. Besides life getting in the way, most of the stack the site was built on has become obsolete and out of date. I couldn't really do much without a major refresh, which I finally managed to complete a few days ago.

Now, for a belated announcement: I published the second edition of **Mastering Vim** (a little over 9 months ago)!

This edition features new (charming) illustrations, updated and improved code examples, and teaches you how to use Vim9script. I've also removed about 30 pages of unnecessary content from the first edition—I'm getting better at writing, after all! I believe the second edition of Mastering Vim is a fantastic introduction to Vim.

I’m also pleased to mention that this edition has been thoroughly edited by Christian Brabandt, a fitting successor as the lead of the Vim project after the passing of Bram Moolenaar, the original creator of Vim, in 2023.

If that sounds interesting, consider picking it up on [Amazon](https://amzn.to/41JSqi1) (unfortunately your local bookstore is unlikely to stock one).
