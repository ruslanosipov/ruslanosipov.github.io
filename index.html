  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I find it easy to get caught up in whatever is on my mind. That&rsquo;s why I find mindfulness practices particularly helpful, and T.E.A. - Thoughts, Energy, Attention - is something I&rsquo;ve been using on and off for a few years to clear my head and focus on work and decisions that matter to me.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/thoughts-energy-attention.png" title="A drawing of a tea cup with Thoughts, Energy, Attention written next to it." ></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s short and simple, and only takes few minutes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Thoughts</strong>: What&rsquo;s on my mind now?

<ul>
<li>Is my train of thought helpful? What can be done to change it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Energy</strong>: How am I feeling?

<ul>
<li>How is my energy level? Can I maintain or improve it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Attention</strong>: What matters to me?

<ul>
<li>What should I focus on? What should I accomplish?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a common variation of the same acronym stand for Time, Energy, Attention - but I found that didn&rsquo;t work well for me. Maybe that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m terrible at estimating or understanding time, or maybe that&rsquo;s because the most important decisions sometimes end up not taking any time at all. Either way, I try not to concern myself with time. Hence: Thoughts, Energy, Attention.</p>

<p>You can read more about T.E.A. in this <a href="https://blog.google/documents/103/T.E.A_Check-in_Guide_-_External_.pdf/">PDF from Google</a>.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>In the past few years my work heavily shifted towards being mostly done in a web browser. Much of what I use today is email and documents, and I&rsquo;m able to SSH into a dedicated Linux machine for rare instances of coding or running some scripts. Because of that my primary machine these days is a trusty Chromebook - really just a web browser with an OS stapled on top of it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://www.rosipov.com/blog/personal-wiki-with-vimwiki/">used Vimwiki</a> extensively for nearly 10 years now: it&rsquo;s a fantastic way to organize my thoughts and everything I learn about the world, and it works with the tool I know and love - Vim. My Vimwiki followed me across machines, and I use Google Drive to keep it in sync regardless of the environment I use the Vimwiki in.</p>

<p>It took me way longer than I would like to admit to get Vimwiki working on my Chromebook: here lies the journey of getting the Vimwiki to work on a ChromeOS. There are three major hurdles I had to jump over:</p>

<ul>
<li>Getting Vim to run on ChromeOS.</li>
<li>Getting Vimwiki, Google Drive, and ChromeOS to play together nicely.</li>
<li>Getting the web view to work.</li>
</ul>


<p>Good news is that ChromeOS allows you to run a Linux environment. Bad news, is that things can&rsquo;t get a tiny bit finnicky.</p>

<p>First, set up Linux to run on ChromeOS via &ldquo;Settings > Advanced > Developers > Linux Development Environment > Turn on&rdquo;. After a few prompts and a freshly brewed cup of coffee, you&rsquo;ll have a Debian Linux environment running on your Chromebook.</p>

<p>Newly installed Linux is accessible from the terminal:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/chromeos-linux-terminal.png" title="Screenshot of a Linux terminal available from ChromeOS." ></p>

<p>Pop open the terminal and update Vim and get the latest version of Python:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install python3 vim
</code></pre>

<p>Download and install Vimwiki however you&rsquo;d like: there are extensive instructions on <a href="https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki">GitHub</a>. If you&rsquo;re anything like me, you might have a <a href="https://www.rosipov.com/blog/cross-platform-vim-plug-setup/">self-installing vim-plug</a>, and all you need is just plop your existing .vimrc into your Chromebook Linux instance.</p>

<p>Now, for getting Google Drive, Vim, and ChromeOS to play together. ChromeOS and Linux are integrated well enough, and you can access your home directory through ChromeOS native file manager:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/chromeos-linux-files.png" title="Screenshot of Linux home directory available in ChromeOS file manager." ></p>

<p>To share files in another direction, there&rsquo;s a handy &ldquo;Share with Linux&rdquo; option for files:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/chromeos-share-with-linux.png" title="Screenshot of &amp;#34;Share with Linux&amp;#34; option in ChromeOS file manager." alt="Screenshot of &amp;#34;Share with Linux&amp;#34; option in ChromeOS file manager."></p>

<p>This option shares files with Linux via <code>/mnt/chromeos</code>. In Google Drive, I have a <code>vimwiki/</code> folder which contains <code>wiki/</code> and <code>wiki_html/</code>. I&rsquo;m able to share that folder, and update Vimwiki configuration accordingly:</p>

<pre><code>let g:vimwiki_list = [{
  \ 'path': '/mnt/chromeos/GoogleDrive/MyDrive/vimwiki/wiki/',
  \ 'template_path': '/mnt/chromeos/GoogleDrive/MyDrive/vimwiki/wiki/templates',
  \ 'template_default': 'default',
  \ 'template_ext': '.html'}]
</code></pre>

<p>Now there&rsquo;s a corner case I ran into when I had Vimwiki set up on a different account than the one I use to log into the Chromebook. Only the primary account&rsquo;s Google Drive shows up in ChromeOS file manager. To work around that, I had to share my <code>vimwiki/</code> folder with the primary account, and then share that with Linux. The resulting directory was available through a <code>/mnt/chormeos/GoogleDrive/ShortcutsSharedWithMe/...</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/chromeos-linux-shared-folders.png" title="Screenshot of Linux folders shared with ChromeOS." ></p>

<p>At this point Vimwiki works just fine: working with the wiki and generating HTML is functional. All that&rsquo;s left is getting the generated Vimwiki to show up in the web browser. Ever since Chrome disabled local file access, I (expectedly) haven&rsquo;t been able to get <code>:Vimwiki2HTMLBrowse</code> to function, since simple <code>file:///</code> URLs aren&rsquo;t accessible for security reasons.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where Python comes in, with it&rsquo;s native web server module. I made a small alias in my <code>.bashrc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>alias vimwiki="cd /mnt/chromeos/GoogleDrive/MyDrive/vimwiki/ &amp;&amp; python3 -m http.server"
</code></pre>

<p>Next thing you know, I&rsquo;m finally able to access the generated web version of my Vimwiki via <code>localhost:8000/wiki_html</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/vimwiki-web-view.png" title="Screenshot of an HTML version of Vimwiki." ></p>

      <h1 class="entry-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/blog/the-eisenhower-matrix/" itemprop="url">The Eisenhower matrix</a></h1>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>The Eisenhower matrix, sometimes known as the priority matrix, is an invaluable
planning tool, and something I have been consistently using for the better part
of the last decade.</p>

<p>As someone who has a short attention span and easily gets overwhelmed, I find
Eisenhower matrix to be an invaluable tool in allowing me to focus on what&rsquo;s
important, rather than what&rsquo;s right in front of me.</p>

<p>Oh, I still struggle to make sure that things that are important to me are
what matters to others, but that&rsquo;s a whole different battle - at the very least
I&rsquo;m able to keep my own head straight, and that&rsquo;s a win in my book.</p>

<p>Without any further ado, I present to you the decision making framework
developed and popularized by Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th president of the
United States (and clearly a notorious efficiency nut).</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/eisenhower-matrix.png" title="Picture of an Eisenhower matrix: vertical axis titled &amp;#34;Importance&amp;#34;, horizontal axis titled &amp;#34;Urgency&amp;#34;, and four quadrants titled &amp;#34;Do now&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Schedule&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Delegate&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;Eliminate&amp;#34;." alt="Picture of an Eisenhower matrix: vertical axis titled &amp;#34;Importance&amp;#34;, horizontal axis titled &amp;#34;Urgency&amp;#34;, and four quadrants titled &amp;#34;Do now&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Schedule&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Delegate&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;Eliminate&amp;#34;."></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s pretty simple, really. Take everything from your long single-file To-Do
list, and place it on the matrix based on its urgency and importance. Work
through the matrix in the following order:</p>

<ul>
<li>Urgent and important: get these done, now.</li>
<li>Important, but not urgent: decide when you want to do these, actively make
time for yourself to work on those.</li>
<li>Urgent, but not important: delegate (read on below if you have no one to
delegate to).</li>
<li>Not urgent and not important: take time to eliminate these tasks.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Do now: a common pitfall</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to throw everything into the &ldquo;urgent and important&rdquo; pile. In reality,
that&rsquo;s not often the case. If you find yourself throwing everything in the first
quadrant - I implore you to think of your tasks in relative terms. Out of
everything on your mind, I&rsquo;m sure some things are more important than others.</p>

<p>I find that over time most of my work shifts into a single quadrant (usually the
&ldquo;important, but not urgent&rdquo;), and I find it helpful to redistribute those, or
populate the matrix from scratch.</p>

<h2>Schedule: mindful use of time</h2>

<p>One of the goals of the Eisenhower Matrix is to increase visibility into how you
spend your time. While it&rsquo;s easy to spend most of the time in the &ldquo;urgent and
important&rdquo; quadrant, the best work happens in the &ldquo;important, but not urgent&rdquo;
section of the matrix. That&rsquo;s where the best use of your time is, and that&rsquo;s
where most of the energy and attention should be spent.</p>

<p>Otherwise you&rsquo;re just running around like a chicken with its head cut off,
although I can sympathise with the difficulty of getting out of the urgency
trap. It&rsquo;s not trivial, and probably downright impossible in some cases.</p>

<p>This is where the biggest pitfall of the Eisenhower matrix lays in my
experience. You want to maximize amount of time spent in the &ldquo;schedule&rdquo;
quadrant, but you don&rsquo;t want to end up with a massive list that becomes a yet
another To Do list, because <a href="https://www.rosipov.com/blog/why-i-threw-away-my-to-do-list/">one dimensional To-Do lists suck</a>.</p>

<h2>Delegate: to whom?</h2>

<p>Not everyone has someone to delegate work to. Or not everything can be
delegated. In these cases, I treat the &ldquo;delegate&rdquo; bucket the same as
&ldquo;eliminate&rdquo;. Hopefully that won&rsquo;t come back to bite me in the future.</p>

<h2>Eliminate: it&rsquo;s hard</h2>

<p>I really like following up on things, to a fault. I don&rsquo;t like leaving loose
ends, unanswered emails, or unspoken expectations. I find it helpful to schedule
time to explicitly eliminate certain work, and communicate explicit expectations
to everyone around me about that. Because of that, that&rsquo;s where the most of my
procrastination happens. Telling people &ldquo;no&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t always easy, and I still
don&rsquo;t have the best process for combing through the &ldquo;Eliminate&rdquo; quadrant.</p>

<p>I know many people are a lot more comfortable letting unimportant things quietly
fall through the cracks, and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>I&rsquo;m making a little cheat sheet for myself. As I progress in my career, much of
my work revolves around communication, and I&rsquo;d be remiss if I don&rsquo;t share a
formal framework I use. I like checklists, spreadsheets, and anything else that
organizes the world around me, and it&rsquo;s fun to make one about communications.</p>

<h2>Checklist</h2>

<p>This is a checklist for high stakes emails, let&rsquo;s dig in:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Goals</strong>

<ul>
<li>What are you trying to accomplish? Why? (It could be worth asking why
multiple times.)</li>
<li>Will this email help you accomplish the goal?</li>
<li>Can the goal be summarized in a single sentence? If not, it&rsquo;s probably not
specific enough.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Audience</strong>

<ul>
<li>Who is the audience?</li>
<li>What does the audience care about? How can you connect the subject of your
email to things they care about?</li>
<li>Does every recipient need to be there? Who&rsquo;s missing?</li>
<li>What action do you want the reader to take? Is there a clear call for
action? For executive communications (who have notoriously short attention
span), you&rsquo;ll want to both start and end with the same call for action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Content</strong>

<ul>
<li>Is there a nuance that would be lost in email that requires face to face
conversation? Does this need to be an email?</li>
<li>Does every sentence and paragraph support your goal?</li>
<li>Does this need a TL;DR?</li>
<li>Is the narrative structure in place? Is there a clear beginning, middle, and
end? No need to write a novel, but without this the content risks being
disjoined.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Impulse</strong>

<ul>
<li>Is now the best time to send it? Friday afternoon is almost always a no-no,
unless you purposely want the reader to pay less attention to the issue.</li>
<li>If this was shared broadly, would you rephrase it? If yes - you definitely
should.

<ul>
<li>To double down, if email is about someone, write as if that someone will
eventually see it. It&rsquo;s fine to be candid, it&rsquo;s not fine to be rude.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Are you angry? Upset? I get notoriously cranky in the late afternoon, and
avoid sending anything important until the next day - or, if time sensitive,
until taking a short break or a walk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s apply this to an example. Say, I&rsquo;m writing a book, and the editor I&rsquo;m
working with hasn&rsquo;t been responsive. I&rsquo;ve tried talking to them about it, but
they&rsquo;re not responsive. I think it&rsquo;s the time to escalate to their supervisor.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the quick, dirty, and impulsive draft I would write:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hello X,</p>

<p>Y hasn&rsquo;t been responsive when reviewing the chapters, and it&rsquo;s really
difficult to get back to chapters after a whole week passes by. By then I
don&rsquo;t even have the context! I&rsquo;ve raised this multiple times and to no avail.
Can you please get Y to be more responsive or find another editor for me to
work with? I haven&rsquo;t been able to make meaningful progress in a month!</p></blockquote>

<p>Pretty brusque, isn&rsquo;t it? I don&rsquo;t normally dissect every email like this, but
sometimes it helps to take a closer look and formalize the decision making
behind each sentence. Thankfully, much of this becomes habitual over time.</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>First things first, I want the editor to be more responsive. Why? To have a
shorter feedback loop when it comes to making changes. Why? To make it easier
to write - it&rsquo;s difficult to come back to the chapter after a long amount of
time passed. Why? This pushes back timelines for each chapter.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really care about how to achieve this goal: the same person can be
more responsive, or maybe I get a new point of contact to work with. Maybe
there are other options I haven&rsquo;t considered.</p>

<p>To summarize in a single sentence, the goal is to &ldquo;reduce the feedback loop&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Audience</h3>

<p>The audience is the editor&rsquo;s supervisor, or maybe someone else from the
editorial team who&rsquo;ll have the incentive to escalate.</p>

<p>I know that the timelines are very important to this publisher, which is
something I can use. I can frame the concerns around impacts of the timeline -
even if it&rsquo;s not something I necessarily care about myself.</p>

<p>Since there are multiple ways to achieve my goal and I don&rsquo;t particularly care
about how, I can make the call for action open ended. I&rsquo;m doing this because I&rsquo;m
comfortable with either outcomes - like the editor not being to improve response
times, but the publisher providing more leniency around the schedule - which,
while isn&rsquo;t ideal, still helps.</p>

<h3>Content</h3>

<p>As multiple people can help me accomplish a goal, and I might not be aware of
all of relevant parties - email format works best.</p>

<p>Narrative structure here is simple - I have a problem (the beginning), here&rsquo;s why
it&rsquo;s bad (the middle), let&rsquo;s fix it (the end).</p>

<p>This email is short enough not to require a TL;DR.</p>

<h3>Impulse</h3>

<p>As my concern is about a particular person, I have to talk about them. I don&rsquo;t
want to avoid candor, but I can approach the situation with empathy and
assumption of best intentions something along the lines of: &ldquo;I understand X has
other commitments&rdquo;. Focusing on facts and leading with empathy would help here.</p>

<p>Having an unresponsive editor is definitely frustrating, so it&rsquo;s worth taking a
step back, and maybe paying extra attention - there&rsquo;s no use having frustration
show through.</p>

<h3>The result</h3>

<p>After running through the checklist, we end up with (what I hope is) a better,
more actionable, and less icky email:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hello X,</p>

<p>When working with Y, it takes up to a week for me to receive feedback on the
chapters I wrote. I understand Y is working with multiple engagements, but
I&rsquo;m concerned about the timelines for the book. If we continue as is, it&rsquo;s
likely we&rsquo;ll have to push publishing date by X months.</p>

<p>Could you help me find a resolution here?</p></blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s short, omits unnecessary details, and leaves the reader with a clear (but
open ended) call for action. Now, all that&rsquo;s left is to schedule send that
email in a morning, and wait for a response!</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><p>Following Europe&rsquo;s 2016 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California passed its own California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in 2020. I won&rsquo;t pretend to understand the intricacies of the law or the differences between the two, but from what I understand this gives you the right to know exactly what data of yours do businesses use, and request that this information is to not be sold or to be deleted.</p>

<p>As a California resident, I decided to dedicate a long weekend to exercising my privacy rights. The long weekend turned into a week worth of back and forth with a dozen-or-so companies, and me having a much better idea of what information about me is out there.</p>

<p>Turned out many large websites provide privacy dashboards where you&rsquo;re able to review and see information collected or inferred about you. But most of this data is hidden behind a formal request process which takes a few days to a week.</p>

<hr />

<p>First, I decided to stroll through Google&rsquo;s privacy settings. There are two ways forward: privacy dashboard, or full-on Google Takeout. Google Takeout allows you to download an archive of <strong>everything</strong> Google has on you, which took a few days to process, and is near impossible to go through while keeping your sanity. So I decided to play with the privacy dashboard instead.</p>

<p>Google Maps has location history of most places I&rsquo;ve visited for the past ten or so years (creepy, but I found it useful on more than one occasion), and YouTube and Search history stores thousands of searches. I already had Assistant history disabled, since storing audio recordings is apparently where I draw the line when it comes to privacy. Targeted ad profile was an interesting thing to look at, accurately summing up my lifestyle in 50 words or less. I ended up disabling targeted ads from Google (and all other services as I went about on my privacy crusade).</p>

<p>Google had some of the finest privacy controls compared to other services, with actionable privacy-leaning suggestions. Google&rsquo;s not known for its services playing well together, but privacy is where Google feels closer to Apple experience - everything is in a single place, surfaced in the same format, easy to control, and plays well together. Given the amount of transparency and fine grained control, I feel pretty good staying in the Google ecosystem.</p>

<hr />

<p>Next I looked at LinkedIn. Outside of the expected things &ndash; emails, phone numbers, messages, invitations, and a history of just about everything I&rsquo;ve ever clicked on, a file labeled &ldquo;inferences&rdquo; stood out. Whether LinkedIn thinks you&rsquo;re open to job seeking opportunities, or what stage of career you are in, or if you travel for businesses, or if you&rsquo;re a recruiter or maybe a senior leader in your company.</p>

<p>Since LinkedIn is a professional network, all information I share is well curated and is meant as public by default &ndash; and I found LinkedIn privacy settings in line with my expectations.</p>

<hr />

<p>As an avid gamer, I went through Steam, Good Old Games, Ubisoft, Epic Games, and Origin privacy details. Unsurprisingly, the services tracked every time I launched every game, shopping preferences, and so on. Thankfully the data seemed confined to the world of gaming &ndash; which made this level of being creepy somewhat okay in my book.</p>

<p>I also looked at random websites I use somewhat frequently &ndash; Reddit, StackOverflow, PayPal, Venmo, AirBnB, and some others &ndash; not too many surprises there, although I did end up tightening privacy settings and opting out of personal data sharing and ad tracking for every service.</p>

<p>Last year I requested deletion of all my data on Mint, Personal Capital, and YNAB (You Need a Budget), and to be honest I&rsquo;m a little relived that I didn&rsquo;t have to look at the data these companies had on me.</p>

<hr />

<p>Amazon data sharing turned out to be the scariest finding. Until now I didn&rsquo;t really self-identify as a heavy Amazon user, but that turned out to be a lie: Prime shopping, Kindle, Audible, Prime Video.</p>

<p>The amount of data Amazon kept on me was overwhelming: Kindle and Audible track every time I read, play, or pause books, the Amazon website keeps full track of browsing habits, and Prime Video has detailed watch times and history. Most of this data ties back into real world &ndash; including nearly every address I ever lived at or phone numbers I had.</p>

<p>Even scarier, despite never using Alexa, I found numerous recordings of my voice from close to a decade ago &ndash; me checking status of the packages, but a few of me just breathing and walking around. I found no way of deleting these, as they didn&rsquo;t show up in any privacy settings (including me installing an Alexa app just to get into privacy settings).</p>

<p>All of this gave me pause. It feels like the privacy controls are either lacking, hidden, or spread out thin across Amazon&rsquo;s various apps. And I&rsquo;ve only briefly scanned through the data Amazon had on me.</p>

<hr />

<p>That&rsquo;s where I had to take a break.</p>

<p>I have accounts with hundreds of services, and I have no idea how my personal data is used, and what it&rsquo;s joined with. As I&rsquo;m go on about my daily life, I&rsquo;ll start tightening privacy controls, and maybe deleting services and their data where possible.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just too creepy for my taste.</p>

<hr />

<p>While you have control over the services you have accounts for, companies and ISPs collect a trove of private information on you even while you&rsquo;re not logged in. For that, I strongly recommend using a VPN. I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/offer/rosipov_o6hmp8nh">PIA</a> since 2019 and I&rsquo;ve been very happy with it. Wholeheartedly <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/offer/rosipov_o6hmp8nh">recommend</a>.</p>
