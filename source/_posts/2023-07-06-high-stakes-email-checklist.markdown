I'm making a little cheat sheet for myself. As I progress in my career, much of
my work revolves around communication, and I'd be remiss if I don't share a
formal framework I use. I like checklists, spreadsheets, and anything else that
organizes the world around me, and it's fun to make one about communications.

## Checklist

This is a checklist for high stakes emails, let's dig in:

* **Goals**
  * What are you trying to accomplish? Why? (It could be worth asking why
  multiple times.)
  * Will this email help you accomplish the goal?
  * Can the goal be summarized in a single sentence? If not, it's probably not
  specific enough.
* **Audience** 
  * Who is the audience?
  * What does the audience care about? How can you connect the subject of your
  email to things they care about?
  * Does every recipient need to be there? Who's missing?
  * What action do you want the reader to take? Is there a clear call for
  action? For executive communications (who have notoriously short attention
  span), you'll want to both start and end with the same call for action.
* **Content**
  * Is there a nuance that would be lost in email that requires face to face
  conversation? Does this need to be an email?
  * Does every sentence and paragraph support your goal?
  * Does this need a TL;DR?
  * Is the narrative structure in place? Is there a clear beginning, middle, and
  end? No need to write a novel, but without this the content risks being
  disjoined.
* **Impulse**
  * Is now the best time to send it? Friday afternoon is almost always a no-no,
  unless you purposely want the reader to pay less attention to the issue.
  * If this was shared broadly, would you rephrase it? If yes - you definitely
  should.
    * To double down, if email is about someone, write as if that someone will
    eventually see it. It's fine to be candid, it's not fine to be rude.
  * Are you angry? Upset? I get notoriously cranky in the late afternoon, and
  avoid sending anything important until the next day - or, if time sensitive,
  until taking a short break or a walk.
  
## Example

Let's apply this to an example. Say, I'm writing a book, and the editor I'm
working with hasn't been responsive. I've tried talking to them about it, but
they're not responsive. I think it's the time to escalate to their supervisor.

Here's the quick, dirty, and impulsive draft I would write:

> Hello X,

> Y hasn't been responsive when reviewing the chapters, and it's really
> difficult to get back to chapters after a whole week passes by. By then I
> don't even have the context! I've raised this multiple times and to no avail.
> Can you please get Y to be more responsive or find another editor for me to
> work with? I haven't been able to make meaningful progress in a month!

Pretty brusque, isn't it? I don't normally dissect every email like this, but
sometimes it helps to take a closer look and formalize the decision making
behind each sentence. Thankfully, much of this becomes habitual over time.

### Goals

First things first, I want the editor to be more responsive. Why? To have a
shorter feedback loop when it comes to making changes. Why? To make it easier
to write - it's difficult to come back to the chapter after a long amount of
time passed. Why? This pushes back timelines for each chapter.

I don't really care about how to achieve this goal: the same person can be
more responsive, or maybe I get a new point of contact to work with. Maybe
there are other options I haven't considered.

To summarize in a single sentence, the goal is to "reduce the feedback loop".

### Audience

The audience is the editor's supervisor, or maybe someone else from the
editorial team who'll have the incentive to escalate.

I know that the timelines are very important to this publisher, which is
something I can use. I can frame the concerns around impacts of the timeline -
even if it's not something I necessarily care about myself.

Since there are multiple ways to achieve my goal and I don't particularly care
about how, I can make the call for action open ended. I'm doing this because I'm
comfortable with either outcomes - like the editor not being to improve response
times, but the publisher providing more leniency around the schedule - which,
while isn't ideal, still helps.

### Content

As multiple people can help me accomplish a goal, and I might not be aware of
all of relevant parties - email format works best.

Narrative structure here is simple - I have a problem (the beginning), here's why
it's bad (the middle), let's fix it (the end).

This email is short enough not to require a TL;DR.

### Impulse

As my concern is about a particular person, I have to talk about them. I don't
want to avoid candor, but I can approach the situation with empathy and
assumption of best intentions something along the lines of: "I understand X has
other commitments". Focusing on facts and leading with empathy would help here.

Having an unresponsive editor is definitely frustrating, so it's worth taking a
step back, and maybe paying extra attention - there's no use having frustration
show through.

### The result

After running through the checklist, we end up with (what I hope is) a better,
more actionable, and less icky email:

> Hello X,

> When working with Y, it takes up to a week for me to receive feedback on the
> chapters I wrote. I understand Y is working with multiple engagements, but
> I'm concerned about the timelines for the book. If we continue as is, it's
> likely we'll have to push publishing date by X months.

> Could you help me find a resolution here?

It's short, omits unnecessary details, and leaves the reader with a clear (but
open ended) call for action. Now, all that's left is to schedule send that
email in a morning, and wait for a response!
