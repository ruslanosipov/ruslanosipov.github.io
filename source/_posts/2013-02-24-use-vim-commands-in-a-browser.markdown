I've been giving preference to a keyboard over mouse since I discovered vim for
myself, as it's a faster and more convenient way to go. I am a Chrome user and
recently I found an amazing plugin: [Vimium][1].

It does exactly what the name suggests, allowing you to use vim-like commands
in your browser. You can freely move, switch between tabs, work with forms and
click links using familiar vim key bindings.

A two minute long introductory video explains basic commands and you're all
set! I've been using Vimium for over a week now, an amusing experience which
allows you to throw your mouse in a dark corner (well, not exactly: Vimium
still has some issues with over-bloated ajax pages, not to mention Flash and
other nasty stuff).

Check it out: [http://vimium.github.com/][1].
