I have set on my journey across the United States and back a few months ago.
It's a fun thing to do, and really gave me a breath of fresh air. I watched
elephant seals and whales on a California coast, spent what felt like days
stuck in LA traffic, ran from a blizzard, made it through a flash flood, passed
a tornado, celebrated New Year's on the road... 

But don't let me get ahead of myself.

## What's inside

My path started in San Francisco Bay Area, a place I've been lately calling
home. I tried out [living out of a Prius][1] before, thus not having a sturdy
place to call home wasn't really a shock. After only a few weeks I didn't feel
like anything is out of place - being on a road feels just as normal as renting
a house.

### Living areas

First - the packing and organization. Just like in any living space, zoning is
important. Space inside a car is separated into 5 major areas:

* A driver's seat, used solely for driving. No other activities are permitted,
  and the less time is spent in the driving seat - the better. This helps one
  to stay alert when on a road.
* Front passenger seat. There's not enough room to sit here due to the seat
  being moved to the front all the way (to give the most space for the bed). I
  usually just keep a backpack here (which I always take with me, so this area
  stays empty when I'm not in the car).
* Rear passenger seat behind a driver. This is a primary seat for activities -
  reading, fiddling around with a laptop, having some tea or a snack. A cooler
  is taking up the leg space, but it's never a problem: in the wilderness I put
  it outside, and nine times out of ten I don't want to sit with my legs down
  (since that's the position I drive in).
* A bed. Level surface, approximately 6 and a half feet long. Sleeping mat,
  winter queen sized sleeping bag folded in two as a second mattress, a summer
  sleeping bag, two pillows, and a plaid on top (for added coziness).
* Additional cargo storage under the bed. Water supply, out-of-season clothes,
  shoes.
* Cargo area in the rear. A suitcase with food and clothes, toiletry kit, and
  miscellaneous stuff. Some things I don't access often are in a secondary cargo
  compartment Prius has underneath the cargo surface.

After about a week, moving between the areas within a car becomes surprisingly
easy and natural. I usually put on a hand brake, lock the car, leave my shoes
in a driver's seat and move to the back sit or the bed.

### Food, water, and cooking

Being prepared is essential for living on the road, so I keep a lot of food and
water in the car. I make it a rule of thumb to keep 6-8 3-liter water jugs in
the car, which amounts to 18-24 liters (5-6 gallons) of drinking water.

For boiling water I use [RoadPro Smart Car Pot][2]. I'll upgrade to something
better eventually, since it requires me to plan too far in advance - it takes
20-25 minutes to get water to boil.

I also have teabags and coffee with me. I used to have instant coffee, but it
tastes terrible compared to the real thing. Now I use a simple one-cup coffee
maker (the one where coffee drips through a funnel) to brew my pre-ground
coffee.

When it comes to food - I use rice, grains, and pasta as a base for some meals.
Canned goods like corn, peas, mixed veggies, pasta sauce, or chili add a nice
touch to the base. I heat up canned soups with a backpacking stove when I'm not
in the mood for cooking whole meals or doing the dishes.

I have a [16-qt Stanley Adventure Cooler][3] which keeps items inside cold for
nearly three days (or practically indefinitely if I'm up in the mountains where
it's cold). When I'm preparing to be out in the wild, I fill it up with eggs,
meat, cheese, veggies, fruits, and berries.

In addition to everything listed above I always carry 6 days worth of MREs and
water in an [emergency backpack][4] underneath in the cargo compartment in case
I am ever stranded somewhere.

### Washing the dishes

For cleaning my cookware I'm using a backpacking approach I've read about on
[WikiHow][6]. I spray the dishes with some natural cleaning solution, let them
sit for a bit, wipe it off with paper towels, and then thoroughly rinse
degreased dishes off in a 5-liter travel kitchen sink.

### Clothing

Most of my clothing is pretty regular - pants, T-shirts, shirts, cardigans,
sweaters, jackets. However I did switch to using merino wool for all my base
layers: underwear, socks, compression tops and bottoms. While being
significantly more expensive, merino wool is much more comfortable to wear, and
it stays clean for much longer than normal clothes.

All the things I wear day to day fit in a backpack. When I stayed in New York
City for a few weeks without a car I had everything I needed in it:

In addition to all of the above, I carry a few pairs of shoes and an additional
outer layer I wear when I anticipate to be near a campfire. That goes in a
storage bin under the bed.

### Laundry

I started with visiting laundromats and just carrying a lot of coins with me.
But after a while, a number of items which require hand washing or delicate
care have increased - mostly due to above specified merino wool base layers.

I've been looking for an excuse to try out [Scrubba wash bag][5] I've heard so
much about - basically a dry sack for washing clothes. I found it to be quite
convenient and not at all cumbersome to use.

While I still use laundromats for washing bulkier items, I hand wash my easy to
clean and quick to dry base layers.

### Sleeping

A self-inflating sleeping pad and a winter queen-sized sleeping bag folded in
half create a great mattress. I sleep in a summer sleeping bag, with an added
sleeping bag liner and a few travel pillows.

I run AC in the car throughout the night. While keeping the temperature
pleasant, it tends to dry out the air and results in a major case of a sore
throat in a morning. I use a small travel humidifier which connects to a USB
power supply to regulate the humidity in the car at night.

### Entertainment

Boredom seems to never be a concern with this lifestyle. I use laptop for rare
acts of writing, and a Kindle for reading during the little downtime I have. I
also have a little harmonica I hope I'll learn to play one day. And some
juggling balls I throw around once in a while.

## A few words on stealth

While I enjoy staying at campsites, a large portion of my journey involved
staying in urban areas. Looking inconspicious is a big deal when you're relaxing
in a car - it's not fun when somebody comes knocking on your door (didn't happen
to me though).

The fact that it's a white-ish Prius helps a lot. Car dwelling is not a first
thing people think when they see a tiny city car parked on the side of the road.
Tinted windows (heavier tint in the rear, lighter in the front) are enough to
shield the dweller from the passers by. A blackout curtain separating the front
seats from the back area and covering rear windows is enough to cover one from
curious eyes peering inside the car.

Here's how the car looks in ful lighting with the curtains down, if you look
closely you can see the black fabric behind the seat backs. But most likely
you'll just pass the car:

Finding a place to stay boils down to four simple steps for me:

1. Drive around in advance, find a place where it's easy to blend it. I prefer a
   balance between empty and fully crowded lots. Avoid parking at a chosen area
   until later in the evening.
2. Arrive late, hide in plain sight, park near similar cars. Don't tuck in
   somewhere far and look suspicious.
3. Be respectful to whichever place you picked for the night. If possible, leave
   it cleaner than it was when you arrived. Try not to be in and out of the car
   too much either.
4. Leave early. Do not stay at one place multiple nights in a row. Avoid easily
   recognizable patterns when returning to the same spot.

## Final thoughts about my journey

I traveled for an approximate of three weeks, and ended up hunkering down in New
York City for another month while leaving a car outside the city.

I gave up my apartment back in Bay Area for the duration of the travel, and it
feels liberating. It's comforting to know that one doesn't need to own a place
to live a happy and fulfilled life. Even further, living in NYC for weeks with a
single backpack worth of posessions and realising I don't need anything else was
an eye opening experience.

Turns out I really don't need much stuff to enjoy life.
