title: Open previously edited file in vim
---

You can open previous location by hitting `Ctrl-O`. You can prefix the command
with a number to go multiple files back. You can also travel forward in "file
history" by using `Ctrl-I`.

There's a nice article on [Vim Wikia][1] with more details on a subject.
