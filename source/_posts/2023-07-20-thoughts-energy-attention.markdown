I find it easy to get caught up in whatever is on my mind. That's why I find mindfulness practices particularly helpful, and T.E.A. - Thoughts, Energy, Attention - is something I've been using on and off for a few years to clear my head and focus on work and decisions that matter to me.

It's short and simple, and only takes few minutes:

* **Thoughts**: What's on my mind now?
  * Is my train of thought helpful? What can be done to change it?
* **Energy**: How am I feeling?
  * How is my energy level? Can I maintain or improve it?
* **Attention**: What matters to me?
  * What should I focus on? What should I accomplish?

I've seen a common variation of the same acronym stand for Time, Energy, Attention - but I found that didn't work well for me. Maybe that's because I'm terrible at estimating or understanding time, or maybe that's because the most important decisions sometimes end up not taking any time at all. Either way, I try not to concern myself with time. Hence: Thoughts, Energy, Attention.
