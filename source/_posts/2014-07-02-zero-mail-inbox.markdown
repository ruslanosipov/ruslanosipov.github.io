I use email a lot. Maybe not as much as some, but I receive and send a fair
share of mail each day. You might find it odd, but I love using email. It's a
pleasant and calm experience, and sorting through a pile of messages every
morning rewards me with a sense of achievement. There are, however, few tricks
I have up my sleeve, and I would like to share them today. These tips will not
necessarily make you more productive, but they will provide you a with a more
pleasant and peaceful experience of managing your inbox.

But first, I would like to set the scene...

## The wonderful Mailbox app

I started using iOS email client called [Mailbox][1] a little over a year ago,
shortly after a release. Back then, before it was acquired by Dropbox, you had
to wait in order for the company to grow their servers. I patiently waited "in
line" for almost a month and I finally was able to transfer all my accounts to
this wonderful mail client.

It was worth waiting for. Right after starting, Mailbox archived all the
conversations in my inbox, and presented me with a list of unread emails which
looked an awful lot like a To-Do list. You can read and reply, archive the
important letters, delete junk, or resend a conversation to yourself after a
certain time span as a reminder. This is an extremely simple idea, but it is
essentially what anyone's inbox is: a list of things which need to be done.
Some emails have to be replied to, some have to be acted upon in some other
way. The ones that don't get archived are deleted right away.

Mailbox turned my trash-filled inbox into a clean list of items I need to do.
Since then, there never was an email I forgot to reply to, nor an important
thing I forgot to do. Inbox can be referred to as "To Do", and an archive as
"Done". This scheme makes it nearly impossible to miss anything of importance.

Unfortunately, Mailbox is an iOS-only application, and I started noticing the
shortcomings of the desktop experience. And I do use desktop mail far more
often than mobile. I decided to have a set of rules for managing my inbox; and
this is the workflow I have been successfully using for over a year.

## Workflow outside of the Mailbox app

I only use Gmail, and there probably are ways to have the same experience on
other platforms. However, the Mailbox app works only with Gmail.

The first thing which needs to be done in order to start using the zero mail
inbox workflow - is to empty it from all the read mail. Thankfully, the Mailbox
app archives all your previous conversations the moment you install it.

Next, there has to be a way to implement a "snooze" button. There are always
times when you can't reply to an email, but don't exactly want to keep it in
your inbox (what an eyesore). Gmail does not provide a native way to resend
your emails at later times, but I found a Chrome extension called
["Snooze Your Email for Gmail"][2], which adds a simple "Snooze" button to the
Gmail UI.

Now that these two things are taken care of, there is a simple set of rules to
be used when a new email comes in:

  * _Delete._ Is it a notification? Does it require saving for future
    reference? A lot of things should be deleted. Bills, notifications,
    messages from robots: these don't have to be saved. Items in Gmail trash
    live for 30 days, which is enough time to find something in case of an
    emergency. In addition, most of this information is available from some
    another source anyway.
  * _Snooze._ Do you have time right now to read/reply/act upon this email?
    Remind yourself about it in a few hours or days instead.
  * _Archive._ Conversation with a real person you might want to reference to
    later? I save all the email chains from humans, just in case I have to
    search through them at a later date.
  * _Reply and archive._ Self-explanatory. Act upon and save for future
    reference.
  * _Let it be._ This is an eyesore version of using the "Snooze" button. You
    usually want to do this only if there are more important emails to read and
    act upon before getting to this one.

Ideally, when you keep items in your inbox - this means they have to be acted
upon in some way. There is no reason not to archive or delete conversations
which don't require actions.

## Bonus point: labels

This is a recent addition to my repertoire. I found myself often searching
through certain sets of email, and hence Gmail does not support regular
expressions it's quite a big pain in the neck for me when I can't remember
certain details. I created a set of thematic labels, which group emails by
projects, products, and teams. And I started religiously assigning them to all
the emails I archive. First it takes a bit of work, but after a while it
becomes easy to identify a pattern and create filters to assist yourself with
categorization.

As a result, I can  narrow down a search to a thematic subset of emails, saving
myself a lot of time and frustration.
