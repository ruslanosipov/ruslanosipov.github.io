I just finished reading "[The Pragmatic Programmer][1]" by Andrew Hunt and
David Thomas - two consultants behind Pragmatic Programmers, LLC. This book
might as well be a fantastic marketing trick for their consulting agency, but
the value it brings to the reader is hard to underestimate.

Hunt and Thomas cover a wide variety of topics, briefly glancing over every
major aspect of developing software: be it the choice of a text editor,
calculating time complexity, or working effectively on a team.

If you read thematic books and actively follow programming blogs and podcasts -
you may find yourself cheerfully nodding while reading sections of this book.
You may have read about some of the tips online, heard from colleagues, or
simply discovered them yourself. You will finish this book with a wide smile of
approval, and a sense of validation in regards to your daily work flow or
actions.

If you are less lucky (say, you don't read as much), you will find 70 tips you
can utilize right away, right now, at your workplace. This is what "The
Pragmatic Programmer" essentially is: a collection of practical things
regarding getting things done.

It's an essential read, and I've seen this book in every single recommended
reading list out there. And for a solid reason. This is the kind of book you
want to re-read every couple of years to absorb every piece of knowledge
presented within it. The latest edition of the book even contains a printout
with all the tips listed in the book.

You should read it after being in the field for a few years. After making
mistakes, and figuring some things out on your own. Beginners might not
understand some pieces, but will still be able to comprehend a major portion of
knowledge contained within this book.

I enthusiastically recommend this book to every software engineer I get to work
with. It's easy to read (as opposed to monstrosities like "[Code Complete][2]"
or "[Art of Computer Programming][3]") and it teaches you how to get things
done, the pragmatic way.
