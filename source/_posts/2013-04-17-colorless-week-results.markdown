A round-up of [The Week Without Colorful Prompt][1].

I worked with the colors disabled in bash, git, and vim for a week. So how did
it go? It is definitely an interesting experience, but such a harsh change that
it doesn't really work out with everything.

## Bash

Disabling colorful PS1 and removing color output for ls commands forced me to
concentrate more on the actual text, changing the perception of the general
bash workflow. I was more concentrated on the task, missed less details, and
generally paid more attention to the output.

## Git

Never repeat my mistake by disabling colors for git diff. Log and status are
fairly easy to read, but the disabling of colors noticeably slows down the
workflow.

## Vim

Vim without code highlight forces you to remember your code structure more
effectively, which is a great thing. Not having a need to rely on color can
hint that a programmer has better understanding of the code he/she is writing.

Now that the experiment is over I have mostly returned to using colorful
prompt. But I do turn syntax highlight off once in a while - it allows you to
see problems from new angle and work more efficiently at finding a solution.
Try it and see for yourself!
