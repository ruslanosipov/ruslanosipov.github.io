I had this lying around for a while now. This is great vim movement commands cheat sheet made by [Ted Naleid](http://naleid.com/blog/) ([link to the original post](http://naleid.com/blog/2010/10/04/vim-movement-shortcuts-wallpaper/)). It does an amazing job aiding in the memorization of essential vim movement shortcuts.
