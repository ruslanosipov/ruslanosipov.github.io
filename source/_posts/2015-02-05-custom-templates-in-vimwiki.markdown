I got myself into a habit of using vimwiki for the past year: it helps me to
keep track of random bits of information, work and project notes, as well as
daily goals and achievements. You can read more about vimwiki in an article I
wrote a while back: "[Personal wiki with vimwiki][1]".

One of vimwiki's features I really like is an ability to convert whole wiki to
HTML with a single command: `:VimwikiAll2HTML`. There is one annoyance though:
HTML vimwiki pages don't have any navigation elements: the only way to navigate
between pages is by clicking through links within a page or using browser's
"back" button.

Luckily, vimwiki has a setting which allows using custom templates for
generating HTML. Assuming your wiki is in `$HOME/Dropbox/wiki` (can be anywhere
else though), make following changes to your `.vimrc`:

	let g:vimwiki_list = [{
	  \ 'path': '$HOME/Dropbox/wiki',
	  \ 'template_path': '$HOME/Dropbox/wiki/templates',
	  \ 'template_default': 'default',
	  \ 'template_ext': '.html'}]

After that, create a `$HOME/Dropbox/wiki/templates/default.html` using
`vimwiki/autoload/vimwiki/default.tpl` as a base. I added simple navigation bar
to my default template:

	<html>
	<head>
		<link rel="Stylesheet" type="text/css" href="%root_path%style.css" />
		<title>%title%</title>
		<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
	</head>
	<body>
		<a href="%root_path%index.html">Index</a> |
		<a href="%root_path%diary/diary.html">Diary</a>
		<hr>
		<div class="content">
		%content%
		</div>
	</body>
	</html>

Now it's much easier to jump between wiki entries. Of course, customization
doesn't end there: you can change styles, add JavaScript and make your wiki all
fancy and advanced.

If you'd like to get even better about using Vim, I wrote a book about it:
[Mastering Vim][2]. I'm pretty proud of how it turned out, and I hope you like
it too.
