Over the past six to nine months I've been working on a book - [Mastering Vim](https://amzn.to/2EfGaN5). Mastering Vim is a passion project which is meant to take the reader (you) from zero to a hero (future you): from knowing nothing about Vim, to becoming a power user. I cover many of Vim's mysterious commands, philosophy behind the beloved editor, configuration tips, a plethora of community created plugins, as well as creating your own plugins.

Mastering Vim was written with support from Packt Publishing and was kindly reviewed by Bram Moolenaar ([website](https://moolenaar.net)) - the creator of Vim. Many people made this book possible, including [VimConf Japan](https://vimconf.org) crew, who kindly hosted me earlier this year. Thank you to everyone for making Mastering Vim happen!

Give it a read and let me know what you think, [Mastering Vim is available on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2EfGaN5)!

P.S: This post, like many others, is written in Vim.
