title: Read man pages from vim
---

I recently discovered an incredibly useful function - you can look up man pages for keywords by pressing `K` (read: `Shift + k`) in normal mode when cursor is over the word you need to look up.

It works with any shell or programming language keywords, as long as vim recognizes the filetype.
