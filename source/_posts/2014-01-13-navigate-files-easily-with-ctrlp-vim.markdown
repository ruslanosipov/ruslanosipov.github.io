title: Navigate files easily with ctrlp.vim
---

Few years ago I used a lightweight IDE called "Sublime Text 2". And one of the most compelling features of it was an ability to switch between files by hitting `Ctrl` + `P` and typing in a part of the file name.

This is exactly what `ctrlp.vim` implements in vim. Usage is extremely simple: install the plugin, hit `Ctrl` + `P`, type a part of the file name, select a desired file and hit `Enter`. You can use arrow keys or `Ctrl` + `J` and `Ctrl` + `K` to navigate between suggested file list.
