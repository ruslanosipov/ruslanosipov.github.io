## Regarding my online presence

There seems to be a number of people out there who use "rosipov" as their username. It's a regular coincidence, since this domain name consists of my first initial and my last name. So, if you see someone online with a username "rosipov" - it might not be me. As a rule of thumb, I usually leave a link to this blog on any profile I use. I also try to keep links to my online profiles (above) up to date on this page.
